The development of this software has been supported by Indiana University,
Cadence Research Systems, Cisco Systems, and a gift from Microsoft Research.
Jordon Johnson implemented an early version of the infrastructure.  The "cata"
syntax and quasiquote extension to handle ellipses is patterned after Erik
Hilsdale's match.ss, an early version of which was written by Dan Friedman.
