Racket is distributed under the MIT license and the Apache version 2.0
license, at your option. However, the Racket runtime system includes
components distributed under other licenses. In short:

  * The traditional Racket runtime system includes code distributed
    under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3. This
    runtime system is built from code in racket/src/racket.

  * The Racket on Chez Scheme runtime system embeds Chez Scheme, which
    is distributed under the Apache version 2.0 license. This runtime
    system is built from code in racket/src/cs.

Except for Windows executables that are created with the "embed DLLs"
option, the runtime system remains separate as a shared library or
additional executable, which means that it is dynamically linked and
can be replaced with a modified variant by users.

See the file LICENSE-LGPL.txt for the full text of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.

See the file LICENSE-APACHE.txt for the full text of the
Apache version 2.0 license.

See the file LICENSE-MIT.txt for the full text of the
MIT license.

Additionally, the default mode of building Racket will install other
packages, which are distributed under their own license. In the
default mode, all of those packages are distributed under the licenses
listed above.

There may also be other licenses for code within this repository with
which you must comply. Some of them are listed below.
