The `gcc' directory holds a copy of libffi from the GCC repository,
with extra files that are needed to configure it.  Similarly, The
`libffi_msvc' directory holds a copy of the libffi version from the
CTypes project.

*** Next update should use the new location of the sources, which is now
    at git://github.com/atgreen/libffi.git

========== gcc directory =============================================

The directory is synced from the GCC repository, revision 140226.

Our copy of libffi for PLT Scheme has been changed in a few small
ways:

Local changes:

 * Removed libffi/testsuite directory (r8401)

 * Removed testsuite mention in configure and make files (r8403)

 * Recreated the libffi/configure with autoconf version 2.61 (r8412)

 * Changed config/multi.m4 to allow in-source-tree builds, rebuild
   libffi/configure (r8413)

 * Removed +live_support in src/powerpc/darwin_closure.S so it builds
   with Mac OS X 10.3 (r8436)

 * Manually added datarootdir handling in libffi/Makefile.in and
   libffi/include/Makefile.in to eliminate warnings, change taken from
   git master source at http://github.com/atgreen/libffi/, tree
   997968323ed45a5ea5db1ff83124619ae1949bfb. (r18350)

Note: recreating "configure" with autoconf 2.61 does not work as is,
since the scripts require 2.59.  To allow this, the two requirements
in "libffi/configure.ac" and "config/override.m4" were temporarily
changed.

========== libffi_msvc directory =====================================

This directory is synced from the CTypes repository

  http://svn.python.org/projects/ctypes/trunk/ctypes

revision 60274.
