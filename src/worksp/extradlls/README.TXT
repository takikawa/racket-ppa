This directory contains extra DLLs that are needed for running PLT
Scheme.  The DLL files are moved into the PLT folder by
 plt/src/mzscheme/dynsrc/mkmzdyn.bat
which is, in turn, called by the MSVC projects.

msvcr71.dll

This DLL has runtime support for applications built by DevStudio 7.1.
It is installed into the Windows system directory with PLT, but is not
removed when PLT is uninstalled.

(Microsoft recommends keeping the file in the application directory,
but this leads to problems with standalone executables, and renaming
this file is difficult.)

uniplt_xxxxxxx.dll

This DLL is really Microsoft's UnicoWS.dll.  Microsoft allows
redistribution of this DLL, but discourages installing it into the
system folder.  So, we rename it (and version-mangle the name) so that
it can be installed into the system folder without conflicts.

This DLL is only loaded by MzScheme/MrEd under Windows 95/98/Me. It's
actually not needed at all under Windows NT/2000/XP.
