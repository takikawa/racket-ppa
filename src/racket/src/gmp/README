This is a portion of the GNU MP Library (a mixture of version 3 and
4), mostly collapsed into a single file for easy distribution with 
Racket.

Creating a separate file instead of just using the standard GNU MP
distrbution feels stupid, but experience suggests that it makes life
much easier overall...
