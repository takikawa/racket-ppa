Some general guidelines for modying this code:

 * Use `scheme_...` for a definition that is globally visible. In
   particular, any non-`static` function name should start with
   `scheme_`.

 * If a globally visible function is meant for exporting to embedding
   applications, extensions, or through the FFI, put the prototype in
   "src/schemef.h" (and re-generate files with `make exports`).
   Functions available only to embedding applications can go in
   "scheme.h". Otherwise, put global function prototypes in
   "schpriv.h".

 * Don't use "//" comments, because we still use pre-C99 compilers
   that don't support them.

 * Declare all variables at the beginning of a block (again, for
   pre-C99 compilers).
