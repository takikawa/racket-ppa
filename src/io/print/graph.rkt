(struct as-constructor (tag)) ; `tag` is #f or a number for graph printing

;; Create a hash table that maps some values to a number,
;; which indicates that that the value should be printed with
;; a `#<n>=` prefix and referenced with `#<n>#` thereafter.
;; The hash table records the <n> to be used as a number,
;; and the printer mutates the table to turn that into `#<n>=`
;; after the first reference.
;;
;; In addition, the table indicates whether an item needs
;; to be printed in constructor form, as opposed to quoted
;; form. Printing in constructor form is indicated by
;; mapping to a wrapped `as-constructor` wapper on an integer
;; or `#f`.
;;
;; During `build-graph`, the table maps a value to one of
;;   - 'checking: currently checking, so finding again
;;     implies a cycle
;;   - 'checked: finished checking, but might be referenced
;;     again, which is relevant if graph printing is one of
;;     we go into graph-printing mode
;;   - number: graph-rereference detected, and assigned
;;     the number via `counter`
;;   - (as-constructor #f): like 'checked, but should be printed in
;;     constructor mode, as opposed to quoted
;;   - (as-constructor number): graph-rereference detected, and
;;     initial reference print in construcor mode
;; If no cycle is detected and `(print-graph)` is false, then
;; values other than `as-constructor` are removed. All
;; 'checked entries will be cleared out before the hash table
;; is returned.
