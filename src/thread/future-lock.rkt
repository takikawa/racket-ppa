;; This module implements a lightweight spinlock for futures and
;; fsemaphores.

;; The overall locking regime depends on this lock order (i.e.,
;; when multiple locks are held at once, they must be acquired
;; in this order):
;;
;;    - fsemaphore [one at a time]
;;    - schedule queue
;;    - futures, lower ID before higher ID
;;
;; A future's lock must be held to change the future's fields, except
;; that the fields to implement the schedule queue should be modified
;; only with the schedule-queue lock held.
;;
;; A future with state #f is available to run, but it must be either
;; `would-be?` (never in the queue, only run by a Racket thread) or
;; currently in a queue for a future pthread to take ownership of the
;; future.
