The Racket Programming Language
===============================

This is the
  Racket | Source
distribution for version 6.1.1.

This distribution provides source for the Racket run-time system;
for build and installation instructions, see "src/README".
(The distribution also includes the core Racket collections and any
installed packages in source form.)

The distribution has been configured so that when you install or
update packages, the package catalog at
  http://download.racket-lang.org/releases/6.1.1/catalog/
is consulted first.
