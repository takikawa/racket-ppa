The Racket Programming Language
===============================

This is the
  Racket | Unix | Source
distribution for version 8.1.
 
This distribution provides source for the Racket run-time system;
for build and installation instructions, see "src/README.txt".
(The distribution also includes the core Racket collections and any
installed packages in source form.)

The distribution has been configured so that when you install or
update packages, the package catalog at
  https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/8.1/catalog/
is consulted first.

Visit http://racket-lang.org/ for more Racket resources.

-------

Racket is distributed under the MIT license and the Apache version 2.0
license, at your option.

The Racket runtime system embeds Chez Scheme, which is distributed
under the Apache version 2.0 license.
The runtime system remains separate as a shared library or
additional executable, which means that it is dynamically linked
and can be replaced with a modified variant by users, except
for Windows executables that are created with the "embed DLLs"
option.

Racket packages that are included in the distribution have their own
licenses. See the package files in "pkgs" within "share" for more
information.
