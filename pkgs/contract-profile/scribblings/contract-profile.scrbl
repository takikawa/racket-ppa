@title[#:tag "contract-profiling"]{Contract Profiling}

@defmodule[contract-profile]

This module provides experimental support for contract profiling.

@defform[(contract-profile body ...)]{

Produces several reports about the performance costs related to contract
checking in @racket[body]. Each of these reports is printed to a separate
file.

@itemlist[
@item{
  @emph{Cost Breakdown} (in @tt{tmp-contract-profile-cost-breakdown.txt}):
  Displays the proportion of @racket[body]'s running time that was spent
  checking contracts and breaks that time down by contract, then by contracted
  function and finally by caller for each contracted function.
}
@item{
  @emph{Module Graph View} (in @tt{tmp-contract-profile-module-graph.dot.pdf}):
  Shows a graph of modules (nodes) and the contract boundaries (edges) between
  them that were crossed while running @racket[body].

  The weight on each contract boundary edge corresponds to the time spent
  checking contracts applied at this boundary.
  Modules written in Typed Racket are displayed in green and untyped modules
  are displayed in red.

  These graphs are rendered using Graphviz. The Graphviz source is available in
  @tt{tmp-contract-profile-module-graph.dot}. The rendered version of the graph
  is only available if the contract profiler can locate a Graphviz install.
}
@item{
  @emph{Boundary View} (in @tt{tmp-contract-profile-boundary-graph.dot.pdf}):
  Shows a detailed view of how contract checking costs are spread out across
  contracted functions, broken down by contract boundary.

  Contracted functions are shown as rectangular nodes colored according to the
  cost of checking their contracts.
  Edges represent function calls that cross contract boundaries and cause
  contracts to be applied. These edges are extracted from profiling
  information, and therefore represent incomplete information. Because of this,
  the contract profiler sometimes cannot determine the callers of contracted
  functions.
  Non-contracted functions that call contracted functions across a boundary are
  shown as gray ellipsoid nodes. @; TODO this explanation is not great
  Nodes are clustered by module. @; TODO explain more


  Each node reports its (non-contract-related) self time. In addition,
  contracted function nodes list the contract boundaries the function
  participates in, as well as the cost of checking the contracts associated
  with each boundary. For space reasons, full contracts are not displayed on
  the graph and are instead numbered. The mapping from numbers to contracts is
  found in @tt{tmp-contract-profile-contract-key.txt}.

  These graphs are rendered using Graphviz. The Graphviz source is available in
  @tt{tmp-contract-profile-boundary-graph.dot}. The rendered version of the graph
  is only available if the contract profiler can locate a Graphviz install.
