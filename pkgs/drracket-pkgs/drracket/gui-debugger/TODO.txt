CHANGES TO MAKE-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ability to add named anchors into code using Special menu in DRS -- use those anchors as tracepoints.

Demo monitoring DrRacket for Robby?

Bind Stop button to kill-all.

On the whole, I like the tool, although it'd be nice to have either
        (a) an interactive pointy-clicky interface rather than figuring
                out line/column co-ordinates, or


Re-direct, or at least prefix, program output from the client so that it can be distinguished from the script

Paramterize print-struct to #f for printing in the script

ERROR-CHECKING/HANDLING---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Make all exposed cells and evstreams read-only by lifting the identity function on them

* Turn script errors into syntax errors (i.e. what happens when you bind to variables that don't exist)
    --take the syntax when the binding is made and save it in a hashtable


TESTING/CAPABILITIES------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Does user interaction work?  Can we step through loops one line at a time waiting for input?  GUIs?

* What kind of interface do we want to dig into frames

* What do we do about binding to a variable and following it EVERYWHERE it goes.  Even if it is assigned to something else.

* Implement access to the result of ananonymous expression: here->(add1 2)
