                                                 (λ (x) (path-string? (syntax-source x)))))])
         (listof vector?)]{

This procedure composes the other pieces of this library together in a way that can be used
for REPL-style experimentation with the results from Check Syntax, as shown in the example
below. The list it returns has one vector for each call that would be made to the
object in @racket[current-annotations]. Each vector's first element is a symbol naming
a method in @racket[syncheck-annotations<%>] and the other elements of the vector are
the arguments passed to the method.

This doesn't work as well for use in a real tool, however, because it doesn't account for
the callback procedures present in @method[syncheck-annotations<%> syncheck:add-arrow/name-dup]
and @method[syncheck-annotations<%> syncheck:add-id-set] and the resulting vectors are probably less
convenient to work with than direct method calls for most uses of this library. Nevertheless,
it gives a quick feel for the results that can come back from Check Syntax.

See @racket[annotations-mixin] for some example code to use the other parts of this library.

  This function creates some local state about a traversal of syntax objects
  and returns two functions. The first one should be called with each of the
  (fully expanded) syntax objects that make up a program (there will be only
  one if the program is a module) and then the second one should be called to
  indicate there are no more. 
  
  The optional argument to the first function is ignored.
  It is left there for historical reasons. In the past it
  was called for each sequence
  of binding identifiers encountered in @racket[define-values], @racket[define-syntaxes],
  and @racket[define-values-for-syntax].
  
  During the dynamic extent of the call to the two result functions, the value
  of the @racket[current-annotations] parameter is consulted and various
  methods are invoked in the corresponding object (if any), to indicate
  what has been found in the syntax object. These methods will only be called
  if the syntax objects have source locations.

  Classes implementing this interface are
  accceptors of information about a traversal

  Do not implement this interface directly, as it
  is liable to change without warning. Instead, use
  the @racket[annotations-mixin] and override
  the methods you're interested in. The
  @racket[annotations-mixin] will keep in sync
  with this interface, providing methods that 
  ignore their arguments.

    This should return @racket[#f] if the source of this syntax object is

    annotations are those in the original file and this is a syntax object
    introduced by a macro and thus has a source location from some other file).

    value that will then be passed to one of the other methods below as 
    a @racket[_source-obj] argument.
