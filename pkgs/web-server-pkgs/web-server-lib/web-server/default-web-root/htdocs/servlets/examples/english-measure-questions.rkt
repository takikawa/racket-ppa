Troyes, in France, where it was first adopted in Europe. The troy
ounce is supposed to have been brought from Cairo during the
crusades. In this weight the pound is divided into 12 ounces, the
ounce into 20 pennyweights, and the pennyweight into 24 grains; hence,
the troy ounce contains 480 grains, and the troy pound contains 5760
grains. The avoirdupois pound contains 7000 troy grains; so that 175
pounds troy equal 144 pounds avoirdupois, or 1 pound troy = 0.82286 of
a pound avoirdupois, and 1 ounce troy = 117/175 or 1.09714 ounce
avoirdupois. Troy weight when divided, the pound into 12 ounces, the
ounce into 8 drams, the dram into 3 scruples, and the scruple into 20
grains, is called apothecaries' weight, used in weighing medicines,
etc. In the standard weights of the United States, the troy ounce is
divided decimally down to the 1/10000 part.\"")
