Set Up, Callbacks, Appending
----------------------------

The choice/list should contain "Apple" and "Banana" for
 starters.

Watch for "Popup!" printed to stdout when you click the choice item.

When you use "Reset", the content should change to "Alpha", "Beta",
 and "Gamma", and selecting them should install the word plus
 "for Reset" into the text field.
