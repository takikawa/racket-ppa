You should see three radioboxes:
  "Left" with one radio button: "Singleton"
  "Center" with two radio button: "First" and "Last"
  "Right" with three radio button: "Top", "Middle", and "Bottom"

Click the "Check" button. "All Ok" should appear in the console.

Click each radio button once. For each click, "Callback Ok"
 should be printed in the console, even if the radio button
 is already selected.

Click the "Check" button. "All Ok" should appear in the console.

Select the first button in all radio boxes.

Click "Select First", "Select Middle", "Select Last" then
 "Select First" again. The appropriate button should become selected
 in all radioboxes each time. (For the two-button box, the
 second one counts as `middle'.)

Click "Select -1" and "Select N". Nothing should happen (because the
 appropriate exceptions are caught). Select the last button in each
 box and try "Select -1" again. Nothing should happen. Return the
 selection to the first item in each box.

Repeat the two steps for the "Select XXX by Simulate" buttons. In this
 case, "Callback Ok" should be printed three times when any button
 is hit. The selection should move appropriately.

Click the "Check" button.
