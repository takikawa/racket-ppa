This is the implementation of DrDr.

It currently only runs on a single machine that is set up in an intricate way.
-- In particular, config.rkt mentions many of those details
-- Also, static/data must be a link to a data directory (/opt/plt/data)

It uses a few of my PLaneT packages and some other ones as well.
