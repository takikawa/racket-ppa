DrDr2 is a network of message passing servers.

- Monitor finds pushes and sends them to the scheduler

- The scheduler receives pushes, prepares a tar ball, and sends
  jobs to the masters

- Each master sends commands to its slave and confirms to the scheduler
  (so that it will receive more commands) 

- The slave receives commands and executes them on a test machine
  and sends the answer to the master

- The master receives the answer and sends it to the analyzer

- The analyzer records data for the renderer and informs the notifier

- The renderer queries the database

----

DrDr2 uses the MongoDB database for storage

DrDr2 is monitored using Monit
