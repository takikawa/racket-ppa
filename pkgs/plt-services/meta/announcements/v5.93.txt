Racket v5.93

Version 5.93 repairs a few problems with the recent v5.92 release (in
preparation for a v6.0 release):

 * fixed a low-level concurrency problem with the GUI library for Mac
   OS X, which especially affected 32-bit builds;

 * fixed GRacket-based launchers (such as `drracket`) in a Unix-style
   installation;

 * expanded the list of recognized OpenSSL library versions;

 * fixed small CSS problems and inconsistencies (relative to v5.3.6) in
   the new Scribble style as used by the Racket documentation; and

 * added the version number back to the "racket" directory within the
   source distribution bundle.
