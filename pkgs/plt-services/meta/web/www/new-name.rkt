    @heading{PLT Scheme is a Racket}

    @nested{Sure, it has parentheses, uses the keyword @tt{lambda}, provides
      lexical scope, and emphasizes macros — but don't be fooled.  PLT Scheme
      is no minimalist embodiment of 1930s math or 1970s technology.  PLT
      Scheme is a cover for a gang of academic hackers who want to fuse
      cutting-edge programming-language research with everyday programming.
      They draw you in with the promise of a simple and polite little Scheme,
      but soon you'll find yourself using modules, contracts, keyword
      arguments, classes, static types, and even curly braces.}


    @heading{Racket is a Scheme}

    @nested{Racket is still a dialect of Lisp and a descendant of Scheme.  The
      tools developed by PLT will continue to support R5RS, R6RS, the old
      @tt{mzscheme} environment, Typed Scheme, and more.  At the same time,
      instead of having to say “PLT's main variant of Scheme,” programmers can
      now simply say “Racket” to refer to the specific descendant of Scheme
      that powers PLT's languages and libraries.}

      @p*{
        The @name{Scheme} part of the name @name{PLT Scheme} is misleading, and
        it is often an obstacle to explaining and promoting PLT research and
        tools.
      @~
        For example, when you type “scheme” into Google, the first hit is a
        Wikipedia entry written from an R5RS perspective.  That's appropriate
        for a Wikipedia page on Scheme, but it's not a good introduction to PLT
        Scheme. As long as we call our language @name{Scheme}, we struggle to
        explain our language, and we are usually forced to start the
        explanation with a disclaimer.  At the same time, to the degree that
        the PLT community has defined @name{Scheme} through market share,
        publications, and educational outreach, we interfere with everyone
        else's ability to define @name{Scheme} — and many have a valid claim to
        that ability.
