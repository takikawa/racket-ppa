Sources:
========

* common: specific code for the racket web pages.

* www: actual content of main site.

* download: content of download site (only installer pages and such)

* */all.rkt: files that just require all the necessary modules to build
  the whole site or sub-sites

* */resources.rkt: files that define the resources for a site (icon,
  css, logo)

* minis: smaller one-source-file sites

* stubs: template "sites" that are intended to be hooked into other
  systems to get the racket look.

To build:
=========

* Run `build.rkt' as the main entry point to building the web pages.
  (Use `-h' as usual.)

* You need to choose `-w' or `-l' for a web or local mode respectively.
  The difference is that in local mode inter-site links are set up as
  relative links so you can see all sites from the resulting
  directories, and this is what you usually need to test things out.
  (You will still need to deal with an occasional addition of
  "index.html" which is not done when looking at file:// URLs.)

* Use `-o <dir>' to specify a directory where the built contents is
  placed, otherwise the content will be placed in the current directory.
  (Use `-f' in scripts to avoid answering the question about deleting
  existing files.)

* If you're not running from a git repository, you will also need to set
  a $GIT_DIR environment variable otherwise the resulting build will not
  have release information for the various builds.  (This doesn't matter
  if you're not working on download pages.)

* You can also include more files that hook additional contents with
  with `-e <some-file>'.  These files are required dynamically, and they
  set things up to add more content building.  The common example here
  is "web/all.rkt" in iplt.
