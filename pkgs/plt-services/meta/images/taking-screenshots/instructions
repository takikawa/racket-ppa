Important: before you add a bunch of images or modify a bunch of
existing ones to reflect some minor gui change in your theme, consider
the fact that binary files changes have a heavy cost in terms of
repository size and performance.  Please minimize the number of such
commits (ie, prefer a single big commit over many smaller ones, avoid
committing files that are not "stable").

* Using GIMP

  To take screen shots of the widgets, you can follow these steps:

  1. Take a widget screen shot

  2. Open it with GIMP

  3. Cut it to 240 x 73

  4. Add a border using Filters/Decor/Add Border...
     + Border X size :: 1
     + Border Y size :: 1
     + Border color :: black
     + Delta value on color :: 25

  5. Combine all layers

  6. Add a drop shadow using Filters/Light and Shadow/Drop Shadow...
     + Offset X :: 8
     + Offset Y :: 8
     + Blur radius :: 9
     + Color :: black
     + Opacity :: 80
     + Allow resizing :: #t

  7. Save as .png

  There are two scripts in this directory that might help in this
  process.  Keep in mind though that the GIMP script is very fragile
  and some tweaking might be necessary to make it work in different
  setups.

  + [[file:widget.rkt][widget.rkt]] ::
    Creates a "canvas" panel with a border, so it is easier to select
    the widget area using GIMP's Fuzzy Select Tool

  + [[file:racket-widget.scm][racket-widget.scm]] ::
    GIMP's script which, when invoked, asks for a window to take a
    screen shot and do the post production to the image.  This script
    should be put inside a specific directory, here being
    "~/.gimp-2.6/scripts", and should be invoked at File/Create/Racket
    Widget.
