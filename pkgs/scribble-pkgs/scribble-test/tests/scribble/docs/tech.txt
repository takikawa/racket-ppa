Check case and “s” normalization: Here is apple. Apples are great! We
all like the fruit of an apple tree.

Check case and “ies” normalization: Here is cherry. CHERRIES are great!

Check non-normalization: Here is egGPlant. No one likes egGPlant. It’s
the fruit of an egGPlant plant. Here is EGgpLANT, which is completely
different.

Check space and hyphen normalization: Here is granola bar. A granola-bar
breakfast is good enough. A granola–bar combination is close enough. You
can eat a spacey granola  bar, too.
