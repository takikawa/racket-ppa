@title[#:tag "chaperones"]{Impersonators and Chaperones}

An @deftech{impersonator} is a wrapper for a value where the wrapper
redirects some of the value's operations. Impersonators apply only to procedures,
@tech{structures} for which an accessor or mutator is available,
@tech{structure types}, @tech{hash tables}, @tech{vectors},
@tech{box}es, @tech{channels}, and @tech{prompt tag}s.
An impersonator is @racket[equal?] to the original
value, but not @racket[eq?] to the original value.

A @deftech{chaperone} is a kind of impersonator whose refinement of a value's
operation is restricted to side effects (including, in particular,
raising an exception) or chaperoning values supplied to or produced by
the operation. For example, a vector chaperone can redirect
@racket[vector-ref] to raise an exception if the accessed vector slot
contains a string, or it can cause the result of @racket[vector-ref]
to be a chaperoned variant of the value that is in the accessed vector
slot, but it cannot redirect @racket[vector-ref] to produce a value
that is arbitrarily different from the value in the vector slot.

A non-@tech{chaperone} @tech{impersonator}, in contrast, can refine an operation to swap one
value for any other. An impersonator cannot be applied to an immutable value
or refine the access to an immutable field in an instance of a @tech{structure
type}, since arbitrary redirection of an operation amounts to
mutation of the impersonated value.

Beware that each of the following operations can be redirected to an
arbitrary procedure through an impersonator on the operation's
argument---assuming that the operation is available to the creator of
the impersonator:

@operations[@t{a structure-field accessor}
            @t{a structure-field mutator}
            @t{a structure type property accessor}
            @t{application of a procedure}
            unbox set-box!
            vector-ref vector-set!
            hash-ref hash-set hash-set! hash-remove hash-remove!
            channel-get channel-put
            call-with-continuation-prompt
            abort-current-continuation]

Derived operations, such as printing a value, can be redirected
through impersonators due to their use of accessor functions. The
@racket[equal?], @racket[equal-hash-code], and
@racket[equal-secondary-hash-code] operations, in contrast, may bypass
impersonators (but they are not obliged to).

In addition to redirecting operations that work on a value, a
impersonator can include @deftech{impersonator properties} for an impersonated
value. An @tech{impersonator property} is similar to a @tech{structure
type property}, but it applies to impersonators instead of structure
types and their instances.


@defproc[(impersonator? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is an @tech{impersonator}, @racket[#f] otherwise.

Programs and libraries generally should avoid @racket[impersonator?] and
treat impersonators the same as non-impersonator values. In rare cases,
@racket[impersonator?] may be needed to guard against redirection by an
impersonator of an operation to an arbitrary procedure.}


@defproc[(chaperone? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a @tech{chaperone}, @racket[#f] otherwise.

Programs and libraries generally should avoid @racket[chaperone?] for
the same reason that they should avoid @racket[impersonator?].}


@defproc[(impersonator-of? [v1 any/c] [v2 any/c]) boolean?]{

Indicates whether @racket[v1] can be considered equivalent modulo
impersonators to @racket[v2].

For values that include no impersonators, @racket[v1] and @racket[v2] can
be considered impersonators of each other if they are @racket[equal?].

Otherwise, impersonators within @racket[v2] must be intact within
@racket[v1]:

@itemlist[

 @item{If a part of @racket[v2] is an impersonator created from one of
       the impersonator constructors (e.g.,
       @racket[impersonate-procedure] or
       @racket[chaperone-procedure]), and if the impersonator is
       constructed with at least one redirection procedure (i.e., a
       value other than @racket[#f] was supplied for a redirection
       procedure), then the corresponding part of @racket[v1] must be
       one of the following:

       @itemlist[

         @item{the same value that is a part of @racket[v2];}

         @item{a value further derived from the part of @racket[v2]
               value using an impersonator constructor; or}

         @item{a value with the @racket[prop:impersonator-of] property
               whose procedure produces an impersonator of the value
               that is a part of @racket[v2].}

      ]}

 @item{If a part of @racket[v2] is a structure or procedure impersonator that was
       created with no redirection procedures (i.e, @racket[#f] in
       place of all redirection procedures for specified operations),
       then the impersonated value is considered in place of that part
       of @racket[v2]. In other words, an impersonator construction
       that does not redirect any access or mutation (but that
       includes some @tech{impersonator properties}) need not be
       preserved in @racket[v1].}

]}


@defproc[(chaperone-of? [v1 any/c] [v2 any/c]) boolean?]{

Indicates whether @racket[v1] can be considered equivalent modulo
chaperones to @racket[v2].

For values that include no chaperones, @racket[v1] and @racket[v2] can
be considered chaperones of each other if they are @racket[equal?],
except that the mutability of vectors and boxes with @racket[v1] and
@racket[v2] must be the same.

Otherwise, chaperones within @racket[v2] must be intact within
@racket[v1] analogous to way that @racket[impersonator-of?] requires
that impersonators are preserved, except that @racket[prop:impersonator-of]
has no analog for @racket[chaperone-of?].}


@defproc[(impersonator-ephemeron [v any/c]) ephemeron?]{

Produces an @tech{ephemeron} that can be used to connect the
reachability of @racket[v] (in the sense of garbage collection; see
@secref["gc-model"]) with the reachability of any value for which
@racket[v] is an @tech{impersonator}. That is, the value @racket[v]
will be considered reachable as long as the result ephemeron is
reachable in addition to any value that @racket[v] impersonates
(including itself).}

                                [wrapper-proc (or/c procedure? #f)]

                                [prop-val any] ... ...)
         (and/c procedure? impersonator?)]{

Returns an impersonator procedure that has the same arity, name, and
other attributes as @racket[proc]. When the impersonator procedure is
applied, the arguments are first passed to @racket[wrapper-proc]
(when it is not @racket[#f]), and
then the results from @racket[wrapper-proc] are passed to
@racket[proc]. The @racket[wrapper-proc] can also supply a procedure
that processes the results of @racket[proc].

The arity of @racket[wrapper-proc] must include the arity of
@racket[proc]. The allowed keyword arguments of @racket[wrapper-proc]
must be a superset of the allowed keywords of @racket[proc]. The
required keyword arguments of @racket[wrapper-proc] must be a subset
of the required keywords of @racket[proc].

For applications without keywords, the result of @racket[wrapper-proc]
must be either the same number of values as supplied to it or one more
than the number of supplied values, where an extra result is supplied
before the others. The additional result, if any, must be a procedure
that accepts as many results as produced by @racket[proc]; it must
return the same number of results.  If @racket[wrapper-proc] returns
the same number of values as it is given (i.e., it does not return a
procedure to impersonator @racket[proc]'s result), then @racket[proc] is
called in @tech{tail position} with respect to the call to the impersonator.

For applications that include keyword arguments, @racket[wrapper-proc]
must return an additional value before any other values but after the
result-impersonating procedure (if any). The additional value must be a
list of replacements for the keyword arguments that were supplied to the
impersonator (i.e., not counting optional arguments that were
not supplied). The arguments must be ordered according to the sorted
order of the supplied arguments' keywords.

If @racket[wrapper] is @racket[#f], then applying the resulting
impersonator is the same as applying @racket[proc]. If
@racket[wrapper] is @racket[#f] and no @racket[prop] is provided, then
the result is @racket[proc] unimpersonated.

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[procedure-impersonator] must be even) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[proc].

If any @racket[prop] is @racket[impersonator-prop:application-mark] and if the
associated @racket[prop-val] is a pair, then the call to @racket[proc]
is wrapped with @racket[with-continuation-mark] using @racket[(car
prop-val)] as the mark key and @racket[(cdr prop-val)] as the mark
value. In addition, if @racket[continuation-mark-set-first] with
@racket[(car prop-val)] produces a value for the immediate
continuation frame of the call to the impersonated procedure, the value is
also installed as an immediate value for @racket[(car prop-val)] as a
mark during the call to @racket[wrapper-proc] (which allows tail-calls
of impersonators with respect to wrapping impersonators to be detected within
@racket[wrapper-proc]).}


@defproc[(impersonate-struct [v any/c]

                             [prop-val any] ... ...)
          any/c]{

Returns an impersonator of @racket[v], which redirects certain
operations on the impersonated value. The @racket[orig-proc]s
indicate the operations to redirect, and the corresponding
@racket[redirect-proc]s supply the redirections.

The protocol for a @racket[redirect-proc] depends on the corresponding
@racket[orig-proc]:

@itemlist[

 @item{A structure-field accessor: @racket[redirect-proc]
      must accept two arguments, @racket[v] and the value
      @racket[_field-v] that @racket[orig-proc] produces for
      @racket[v]; it must return a replacement for
      @racket[_field-v]. The corresponding field must not be
      immutable, and either the field's structure type must be
      accessible via the current @tech{inspector} or one of the other
      @racket[orig-proc]s must be a structure-field mutator for the
      same field.}

 @item{A structure-field mutator: @racket[redirect-proc] must accept
      two arguments, @racket[v] and the value @racket[_field-v]
      supplied to the mutator; it must return a replacement for
      @racket[_field-v] to be propagated to @racket[orig-proc] and
      @racket[v].}

 @item{A property accessor: @racket[redirect-proc] uses the same
       protocol as for a structure-field accessor. The accessor's
       property must have been created with @racket['can-impersonate]
       as the second argument to @racket[make-struct-type-property].}

]

When a @racket[redirect-proc] is @racket[#f], the corresponding
@racket[orig-proc] is unaffected. Supplying @racket[#f] for a
@racket[redirect-proc] is useful to allow its @racket[orig-proc] to
act as a ``witness'' of @racket[v]'s representation and enable the
addition of @racket[prop]s.

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[impersonate-struct] must be odd) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[v].

Each @racket[orig-proc] must indicate a distinct operation. If no
@racket[orig-proc]s are supplied, then no @racket[prop]s must be
supplied. If @racket[orig-proc]s are supplied only with @racket[#f]
@racket[redirect-proc]s and no @racket[prop]s are supplied, then
@racket[v] is returned unimpersonated.

If any @racket[orig-proc] is itself an impersonator, then a use of the
accessor or mutator that @racket[orig-proc] impersonates is redirected
for the resulting impersonated structure to use @racket[orig-proc] on
@racket[v] before @racket[redirect-proc] (in the case of accessor) or
after @racket[redirect-proc] (in the case of a mutator).}


@defproc[(impersonate-vector [vec (and/c vector? (not/c immutable?))]

                             [prop-val any] ... ...)
          (and/c vector? impersonator?)]{

Returns an impersonator of @racket[vec], which redirects the
@racket[vector-ref] and @racket[vector-set!] operations.

The @racket[ref-proc] must accept @racket[vec], an index passed to
@racket[vector-ref], and the value that @racket[vector-ref] on
@racket[vec] produces for the given index; it must produce a
replacement for the value, which is the result of @racket[vector-ref]
on the impersonator.

The @racket[set-proc] must accept @racket[vec], an index passed to
@racket[vector-set!], and the value passed to @racket[vector-set!]; it
must produce a replacement for the value, which is used
with @racket[vector-set!] on the original @racket[vec] to install the
value.

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[impersonate-vector] must be odd) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[vec].}

@defproc[(impersonate-box [box (and/c box? (not/c immutable?))]

                          [prop-val any] ... ...)
          (and/c box? impersonator?)]{

Returns an impersonator of @racket[box], which redirects the
@racket[unbox] and @racket[set-box!] operations.

The @racket[unbox-proc] must accept @racket[box] and the value that
@racket[unbox] produces on @racket[box]; it must produce a replacement
value, which is the result of @racket[unbox] on the impersonator.

The @racket[set-proc] must accept @racket[box] and the value passed to
@racket[set-box!]; it must produce a replacement
value, which is used with @racket[set-box!] on the original
@racket[box] to install the value.

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[impersonate-box] must be odd) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[box].}


@defproc[(impersonate-hash [hash (and/c hash? (not/c immutable?))]

                           [prop-val any] ... ...)
          (and/c hash? impersonator?)]{

Returns an impersonator of @racket[hash], which redirects the
@racket[hash-ref], @racket[hash-set!] or @racket[hash-set] (as
applicable), @racket[hash-remove] or @racket[hash-remove!] (as
applicable), @racket[hash-clear] or @racket[hash-clear!] (as
applicable and if @racket[clear-proc] is not @racket[#f]) operations. When
@racket[hash-set], @racket[hash-remove] or @racket[hash-clear] is used on an impersonator of a hash
table, the result is an impersonator with the same redirecting procedures. 
In addition, operations like
@racket[hash-iterate-key] or @racket[hash-map], which extract
keys from the table, use @racket[key-proc] to filter keys extracted
from the table. Operations like @racket[hash-iterate-value] or
@racket[hash-iterate-map] implicitly use @racket[hash-ref] and
therefore redirect through @racket[ref-proc].

The @racket[ref-proc] must accept @racket[hash] and a key passed
to @racket[hash-ref]. It must return a replacement key
as well as a procedure. The returned procedure is called only if the
returned key is found in @racket[hash] via @racket[hash-ref], in which
case the procedure is called with @racket[hash], the previously
returned key, and the found value. The returned procedure must itself
return a replacement for the found value.

The @racket[set-proc] must accept @racket[hash], a key passed to
@racket[hash-set!] or @racket[hash-set], and the value passed to
@racket[hash-set!] or @racket[hash-set]; it must produce two values: a
replacement for the key and a replacement for the value. The returned
key and value are used with @racket[hash-set!] or @racket[hash-set] on
the original @racket[hash] to install the value.

The @racket[remove-proc] must accept @racket[hash] and a key passed to
@racket[hash-remove!] or @racket[hash-remove]; it must produce the a
replacement for the key, which is used with @racket[hash-remove!] or
@racket[hash-remove] on the original @racket[hash] to remove any
mapping using the (impersonator-replaced) key.

The @racket[key-proc] must accept @racket[hash] and a key that has
been extracted from @racket[hash] (by @racket[hash-iterate-key] or
other operations that use @racket[hash-iterate-key] internally); it
must produce a replacement for the key, which is then reported as a
key extracted from the table.

If @racket[clear-proc] is not @racket[#f], it must accept
@racket[hash] as an argument, and its result is ignored. The fact that
@racket[clear-proc] returns (as opposed to raising an exception or
otherwise escaping) grants the capability to remove all keys from @racket[hash].
If @racket[clear-proc] is @racket[#f], then @racket[hash-clear] or
@racket[hash-clear!] on the impersonator is implemented using
@racket[hash-iterate-key] and @racket[hash-remove] or @racket[hash-remove!].

The @racket[hash-iterate-value], @racket[hash-map], or
@racket[hash-for-each] functions use a combination of
@racket[hash-iterate-key] and @racket[hash-ref]. If a key
produced by @racket[key-proc] does not yield a value through
@racket[hash-ref], then the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract].

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[impersonate-hash] must be odd) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[hash].}

Returns an impersonator of @racket[channel], which redirects the
@racket[channel-get] and @racket[channel-put] operations.

The @racket[get-proc] generator is called on @racket[channel-get]
or any other operation that fetches results from the channel (such
as a @racket[sync] on the channel). The @racket[get-proc] must return
two values: a @tech{channel} that is an impersonator of @racket[channel], and a
procedure that is used to check the channel's contents.

The @racket[put-proc] must accept @racket[channel] and the value passed to
@racket[channel-put]; it must produce a replacement
value, which is used with @racket[channel-put] on the original
@racket[channel] to send the value over the channel.

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments

Returns an impersonator of @racket[prompt-tag], which redirects
the @racket[call-with-continuation-prompt] and
@racket[abort-current-continuation] operations.

The @racket[handle-proc] must accept the values that the handler
of a continuation prompt would take and it must produce replacement
values, which will be passed to the handler.

The @racket[abort-proc] must accept the values passed to
@racket[abort-current-continuation]; it must produce replacement
values, which are aborted to the appropriate prompt.

The @racket[cc-guard-proc] must accept the values produced by
@racket[call-with-continuation-prompt] in the case that a
non-composable continuation is applied to replace the continuation
that is delimited by the prompt, but only if
@racket[abort-current-continuation] is not later used to abort the
continuation delimited by the prompt (in which case
@racket[abort-proc] is used).

The @racket[callcc-impersonate-proc] must accept a procedure that
guards the result of a continuation captured by
@racket[call-with-current-continuation] with the impersonated prompt
tag. The @racket[callcc-impersonate-proc] is applied (under a
@tech{continuation barrier}) when the captured continuation is applied
to refine a guard function (initially @racket[values]) that is
specific to the delimiting prompt; this prompt-specific guard is
ultimately composed with any @racket[cc-guard-proc] that is in effect
at the delimiting prompt, and it is not used in the same case that a
@racket[cc-guard-proc] is not used (i.e., when
@racket[abort-current-continuation] is used to abort to the
prompt). In the special case where the delimiting prompt at
application time is a thread's built-in initial prompt,
@racket[callcc-impersonate-proc] is ignored (partly on the grounds
that the initial prompt's result is ignored).

Pairs of @racket[prop] and @racket[prop-val] (the number of arguments
to @racket[impersonate-prompt-tag] must be odd) add impersonator properties
or override impersonator-property values of @racket[prompt-tag].

@defthing[prop:impersonator-of struct-type-property?]{

A @tech{structure type property} (see @secref["structprops"]) that
supplies a procedure for extracting an impersonated value from a structure
that represents an impersonator. The property is used for @racket[impersonator-of?]
as well as @racket[equal?].

The property value must be a procedure of one argument, which is a
structure whose structure type has the property. The result can be
@racket[#f] to indicate the structure does not represent an impersonator,
otherwise the result is a value for which the original structure is an
impersonator (so the original structure is an @racket[impersonator-of?] and
@racket[equal?] to the result value). The result value must have the
same @racket[prop:impersonator-of] and @racket[prop:equal+hash] property
values as the original structure, and the property values must be
inherited from the same structure type (which ensures some consistency
between @racket[impersonator-of?] and @racket[equal?]).}
