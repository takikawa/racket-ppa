Run the MzCOM tests with

 mzscheme -mvqf test.ss

The tests exercise the three COM methods of MzCOM, namely

 About
 Reset
 Eval

Note that some of the tests deliberately cause COM exceptions,
which are handled in the Scheme code.  The details of those
exceptions are displayed to make sure they're the ones we 
expected -- these are not errors.

If the number of detected errors is greater than 0, an 
error count is printed.
