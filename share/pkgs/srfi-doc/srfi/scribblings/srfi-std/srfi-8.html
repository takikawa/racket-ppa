<h2>Related SRFIs</h2>

<p>
The syntax proposed in this SRFI is used in the reference implementation of
<a href="srfi-1.html">SRFI-1</a>, ``List library.''
</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The only mechanism that R<sup>5</sup>RS provides for binding identifiers to
the values of a multiple-valued expression is the primitive
<code>call-with-values</code>.  This SRFI proposes a more concise, more
readable syntax for creating such bindings.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
Although R<sup>5</sup>RS supports multiple-valued expressions, it provides
only the essential procedures <code>values</code> and
<code>call-with-values</code>.  It is evident that the authors expected
Scheme programmers to define other constructs in terms of these,
abstracting common patterns of use.
</p>

<p>
One such pattern consists in binding an identifier to each of the values of
a multiple-valued expression and then evaluating an expression in the scope
of the bindings.  As an instance of this pattern, consider the following
excerpt from a quicksort procedure:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(call-with-values
  (lambda ()
    (partition (precedes pivot) others))
  (lambda (fore aft)
    (append (qsort fore) (cons pivot (qsort aft)))))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here <code>partition</code> is a multiple-valued procedure that takes two
arguments, a predicate and a list, and returns two lists, one comprising
the list elements that satisfy the predicate, the other those that do not.
The purpose of the expression shown is to partition the list
<code>others</code>, sort each of the sublists, and recombine the results
into a sorted list.
</p>

<p>
For our purposes, the important step is the binding of the identifiers
<code>fore</code> and <code>aft</code> to the values returned by
<code>partition</code>.  Expressing the construction and use of these
bindings with the <code>call-by-values</code> primitive is cumbersome: One
must explicitly embed the expression that provides the values for the
bindings in a parameterless procedure, and one must explicitly embed the
expression to be evaluated in the scope of those bindings in another
procedure, writing as its parameters the identifiers that are to be bound
to the values received.
</p>

<p>
These embeddings are boilerplate, exposing the underlying binding mechanism
but not revealing anything relevant to the particular program in which it
occurs.  So the use of a syntactic abstraction that exposes only the
interesting parts -- the identifiers to be bound, the multiple-valued
expression that supplies the values, and the body of the receiving
procedure -- makes the code more concise and more readable:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
(receive (fore aft) (partition (precedes pivot) others)
  (append (qsort fore) (cons pivot (qsort aft))))
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The advantages are similar to those of a <code>let</code>-expression over a 
procedure call with a <code>lambda</code>-expression as its operator.  In
both cases, cleanly separating a ``header'' in which the bindings are
established from a ``body'' in which they are used makes it easier to
follow the code.
</p>

<h2 id="receive">Specification</h2>

<p>
<code>(receive</code> &lt;formals&gt; &lt;expression&gt;
&lt;body&gt;<code>)</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;library&nbsp;syntax 
</p>

<p>
&lt;Formals&gt;, &lt;expression&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; are as described in
R<sup>5</sup>RS.  Specifically, &lt;formals&gt; can have any of three
forms:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<code>(</code>&lt;variable<sub>1</sub>&gt; <code>...</code>
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i></sub>&gt;<code>)</code>: The environment in which 
the <code>receive</code>-expression is evaluated is extended by binding
&lt;variable<sub>1</sub>&gt;, ...,
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i></sub>&gt; to fresh locations.  The
&lt;expression&gt; is evaluated, and its values are stored into those
locations.  (It is an error if &lt;expression&gt; does not have exactly
<i>n</i> values.)
</p></li>

<li><p>
&lt;variable&gt;: The environment in which the
<code>receive</code>-expression is evaluated is extended by binding 
&lt;variable&gt; to a fresh location.  The &lt;expression&gt; is evaluated,
its values are converted into a newly allocated list, and the list is
stored in the location bound to &lt;variable&gt;.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<code>(</code>&lt;variable<sub>1</sub>&gt; <code>...</code>
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i></sub>&gt; . &lt;variable<sub><i>n</i> +
1</sub>&gt;<code>)</code>:  The environment in which 
the <code>receive</code>-expression is evaluated is extended by binding
&lt;variable<sub>1</sub>&gt;, ...,
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i> + 1</sub>&gt; to fresh locations.  The
&lt;expression&gt; is evaluated.  Its first <i>n</i> values are stored into
the locations bound to &lt;variable<sub>1</sub>&gt; <code>...</code>
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i></sub>&gt;.  Any remaining values are converted
into a newly allocated list, which is stored into the location bound to 
&lt;variable<sub><i>n</i> + 1</sub>&gt;.  (It is an error if
&lt;expression&gt; does not have at least
<i>n</i> values.)
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In any case, the expressions in &lt;body&gt; are evaluated sequentially in
the extended environment.  The results of the last expression in the body
are the values of the <code>receive</code>-expression.
</p>

<h2>Reference implementation</h2>

<pre>
<code>
(define-syntax receive
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((receive formals expression body ...)
     (call-with-values (lambda () expression)
                       (lambda formals body ...)))))
</code>
</pre>
