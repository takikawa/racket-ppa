<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This SRFI defines a modular and portable mechanism for
eager comprehensions extending the algorithmic language Scheme
<a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a>.
An eager comprehension is a convenient notation
for one or more nested or parallel loops generating
a sequence of values, and accumulating this sequence into a result.
In its most simple form, a comprehension according to this SRFI
looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote id="example1"><pre><code>(<a href="#list-ec">list-ec</a> (<a href="#%3A">:</a> i 5) (* i i)) =&gt; (0 1 4 9 16)</code>.</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here, <code>i</code> is a local variable that is sequentially
bound to the values 0, 1, ..., 4,  and the squares of these
numbers are collected in a list.
The following example illustrates most conventions of this SRFI
with respect to nesting and syntax:
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>(<a href="#list-ec">list-ec</a> (<a href="#%3A">:</a> n 1 4) (<a href="#%3A">:</a> i n) (list n i)) =&gt; ((1 0) (2 0) (2 1) (3 0) (3 1) (3 2))</code>.</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In the example, the variable <code>n</code> is first bound to 1
then to 2 and finally to 3, and for each binding of <code>n</code>
the variable <code>i</code> is bound to the values
0, 1, ..., <code>n</code>-1 in turn.
The expression <code>(list n i)</code> constructs a two-element list for
each bindings, and the comprehension <code>list-ec</code> collects
all these results in a list.
</p>
<p>
The mechanism defined in this SRFI has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
The set of comprehensions defined for this SRFI is inspired by
those procedures and macros of <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 6.]</a>
leading to natural comprehensions such as
<a href="#list-ec"><code>list-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#append-ec"><code>append-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#sum-ec"><code>sum-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#min-ec"><code>min-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#every%3F-ec"><code>every?-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#do-ec"><code>do-ec</code></a>, and others.
Some other natural comprehensions (e.g. <code>gcd-ec</code>) have
not been included into this SRFI due to their low significance
for most applications.
On the other hand, a few comprehensions
(<a href="#fold-ec"><code>fold-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a>)
not inspired by <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a> have been
included due to their broad applicability.
</li>

<li>
There are typed generators
(<a href="#%3Alist"><code>:list</code></a>, <a href="#%3Alist"><code>:string</code></a>, ...)
expecting certain types of objects for their arguments.
These generators usually produce code as efficient as
hand coded <code>do</code>-loops.
</li>

<li>
There is also the special generator <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>
(read 'run through')
dispatching on the value of its argument list at runtime.
In the examples above, one or two integers were used to define a range.
The convenience of omitting the type comes at a certain
performance penalty, both per iteration and during startup of the loop.
</li>

<li>
Generators can be nested depth-first (as in the example above),
run in parallel (with an optional <a href="#vars">index variable</a>
or more generally with <a href="#%3Aparallel"><code>:parallel</code></a>),
and can be stopped early before (<a href="#%3Awhile"><code>:while</code></a>)
or after (<a href="#%3Auntil"><code>:until</code></a>)
producing the current value.
</li>

<li>
The sequence of values can be filtered
(<a href="#if"><code>if</code></a>, <a href="#not"><code>not</code></a>,
<a href="#and"><code>and</code></a>, <a href="#or"><code>or</code></a>),
intermediate commands can be evaluated between
generators (<a href="#begin"><code>begin</code></a>), and
intermediate variables can be introduced (<a href="#%3Alet"><code>:let</code></a>).
</li>
<li>
The mechanism is fully modular.
This means that no existing macro or procedure needs
to be modified when adding
<a href="#foo-ec">application-specific comprehensions</a>,
<a href="#%3Afoo">application-specific typed generators</a>,
or <a href="#%3Adfoo">application-specific dispatching generators</a>.
</li>

<li>
Syntactically, this SRFI uses the
[<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>] convention,
meaning that the most right generator (<i>inner</i>) spins fastest
and is followed by the result expression over which the
comprehension ranges (<i>expr</i>).
Refer to the <a href="#convention">Section "Design Rationale"</a>.
Moreover, the syntax is strictly prefix and the naming
convention <code>my-comprehension-ec</code>,
<code>:my-generator</code> is used systematically.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
The remainder of this document is organized as follows.
In section <a href="#rationale">Rationale</a> a brief
introduction is given what the motivation is for this SRFI.
The following section <a href="#specification">Specification</a>
defines the mechanism.
Section <a href="#ext-examples">Suggestions for
Application-specific Extensions</a> presents some ideas
how extensions using this SRFI could look like.
The section <a href="#design">Design Rationale</a> contains
some considerations that went into the design of the
mechanism as defined in the specification.
The following section <a href="#related-work">Related Work
and Acknowledgements</a> briefly reviews other proposals
related to Scheme and comprehensions or loops.
Finally, the section <a href="#refimpl">Reference
Implementation</a> gives source code for a reference
implementation together with a collection of runnable
examples and a few examples on extensions.
</p>

<h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this SRFI is to provide a compact notation
for many common cases of loops, in particular those
constructing values for further computation.
The origin of this SRFI is my frustration that
there is no simple for the list of integers
from 0 to <i>n</i>-1.
With this SRFI it is <code>(list-ec (: i n) i)</code>.
Refer to the collection of examples for the
<a href="#refimpl">reference implementation</a>
what it can be used for, and what it should not be used for.
To give a practically useful example,
the following procedure computes the sorted
list of all prime numbers below a certain bound
(you may want to run it yourself to get an idea of
its efficiency):
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
(define (eratosthenes n)          ; primes in {2..n-1} for n &gt;= 1
  (let ((p? (make-string n #\1)))
    (do-ec (:range k 2 n)
           (if (char=? (string-ref p? k) #\1))
           (:range i (* 2 k) n k)
           (string-set! p? i #\0) )
    (list-ec (:range k 2 n) (if (char=? (string-ref p? k) #\1)) k) ))</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Apart from <i>make simple things simple</i>,
there is no other paradigm involved for this SRFI.
In particular, it is not the ambition to implement the
powerful <i>lazy</i> list comprehensions of other functional
programming languages in Scheme.
If you are looking for that you may want to refer to
<a href="#SRFI40">[SRFI 40]</a>.
(The usual definition of the stream of all primes does
in fact also use Eratosthenes' sieve method.
It is instructive to compare.)
</p>
<p>
The main focus of the design of this SRFI is portability under
<a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a> and modularity for extension.
Portability is achieved by limiting the features included.
Modularity for generators is achieved by a special
implementation technique using <i>Continuation
Passing Style</i> for macros (which I learned from
Richard Kelsey's implementation of "Macros for writing loops",
<a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>) and by limiting the
expressive power of generators.
Modularity for comprehensions requires no additional effort.
As modularity was a major design goal, I hope many people will
find it easy to define their own comprehensions and generators.
As a starting point for doing so, I have included several
<a href="#ext-examples">suggestions</a> for extensions.
</p>
<p>
For a detailed motivation of the design decisions,
please refer to the <a href="#design">Section "Design Rationale"</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

<p>
A comprehension is a hygienic, referentially transparent macro
in the sense of <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 4.3.]</a>.
The macros extend the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>-syntax
defined in <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 7.1.3.]</a>.
The main syntactic pattern used for defining a comprehension is
<code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>, representing a generator or a filter.
It is defined in <a href="#qualifiers">Section "Qualifiers"</a>.</p><p>
</p>
<p>
The most important instances of <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code> are generators.
These are defined in <a href="#generators">Section "Generators"</a>.
Generators come in three flavors,
as <i>typed generators</i>
(<a href="#%3Alist"><code>:list</code></a>,
<a href="#%3Arange"><code>:range</code></a> etc.),
as <i>the dispatching generator</i> <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>
(pronounced as 'run through'),
and as combined and modified generators
(<a href="#%3Aparallel"><code>:parallel</code></a>,
<a href="#%3Awhile"><code>:while</code></a>,
<a href="#%3Auntil"><code>:until</code></a>).
Most generators in this SRFI also support an optional
<a href="#vars">index variable</a> counting the
values being generated.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it is explained how to add a new
<a href="#foo-ec">application-specific comprehension</a>,
how to add a new <a href="#%3Afoo">application-specific typed generator</a>,
and how to add a new
<a href="#%3Adfoo">application-specific dispatching generator</a>.
As this concerns code unknown at the time this is being written,
the explanation should not be taken as
a <i>specification</i> in the literal sense.
It rather suggests a convention to follow in order to
ensure new comprehensions and generators blend seamlessly with
the ones defined in this SRFI.

Reduces the sequence <i>x</i>[0], <i>x</i>[1], ..., <i>x</i>[<i>n</i>-1]
of values obtained by evaluating <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> once
for each binding as specified by <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>*.
The arguments <code>&lt;x0&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;f2&gt;</code>,
and <code>&lt;f1&gt;</code>, all syntactically equivalent to
<code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>, specify the reduction process.
</p>
<p>
The reduction process for <code>fold-ec</code> is defined as follows.
A reduction variable <code>x</code> is initialized to the value
of <code>&lt;x0&gt;</code>,
and for each <i>k</i> in {0, ..., <i>n</i>-1} the command
<code>(set! x (&lt;f2&gt; </code><i>x</i>[<i>k</i>]<code> x))</code>
is evaluated.
Finally, <code>x</code> is returned as the value of the comprehension.
</p>
<p>
The reduction process for <code>fold3-ec</code> is different.
If and only if <i>n</i> = 0, i.e. the sequence is empty, then
<code>&lt;x0&gt;</code> is evaluated and returned as the value
of the comprehension.
Otherwise, a reduction variable <code>x</code> is initialized
to the value of <code>(&lt;f1&gt; </code><i>x</i>[0]<code>)</code>,
and for each <i>k</i> in {1, ..., <i>n</i>-1} the command
<code>(set! x (&lt;f2&gt; </code><i>x</i>[<i>k</i>]<code> x))</code>
is evaluated.
Finally, <code>x</code> is returned as the value of the comprehension.
</p>
<p>
As the order of the arguments suggests,
<code>&lt;x0&gt;</code> is evaluated outside the scope of the
qualifiers, whereas the reduction expressions involving
<code>&lt;f1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;f2&gt;</code> are
inside the scope of the qualifiers (so they may depend on
any variable introduced by the qualifiers).
Note that <code>&lt;f2&gt;</code> is evaluated repeatedly,
with any side-effect or overhead this might have.
</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these comprehensions is
implementing other comprehensions as special cases.
They are generalizations of the procedures
<code>fold</code> and <code>reduce</code> in the sense of
<a href="#SRFI1">[SRFI 1]</a>.
(Concerning naming and argument order, please refer to
the discussion archive of SRFI 1, in particular
the posting <a href="#Folds">[Folds]</a>.)
Note that <code>fold3-ec</code> is defined such that
<code>&lt;x0&gt;</code> is only evaluated in case the
sequence is empty.
This allows raising an error for the empty sequence,
as in the example definition of <code>min-ec</code> below.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="foo-ec"></a>
<code>&lt;application-specific comprehension&gt;</code>
</dt>

<dd>
<p>
An important aspect of this SRFI is a modular mechanism
to define application-specific comprehensions.
To create a new comprehension a hygienic macro
of this name is defined.
The macro transforms the new comprehension patterns
into instances of <a href="#do-ec"><code>do-ec</code></a>, which is the most
fundamental eager comprehension, or any other comprehension
already defined.
For example, the following code defines
<a href="#list-ec"><code>list-ec</code></a> and
<a href="#min-ec"><code>min-ec</code></a>
in terms of <a href="#fold-ec"><code>fold-ec</code></a>
and <a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a>:
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>
(define-syntax list-ec
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((list-ec etc1 etc ...)
     (reverse (fold-ec '() etc1 etc ... cons)) )))

(define-syntax min-ec
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((min-ec etc1 etc ...)
     (fold3-ec (min) etc1 etc ... min min) )))</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>
Note that the pattern <code>etc1 etc ...</code> matches
the syntax <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>*<code> &lt;expression&gt;</code>
without separate access to <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>*<code></code>
and <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>.
In order to define a comprehension that does need explicit
access to the <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code>-part,
the following method is used.
First, all qualifiers are collected into a
<a href="#nested"><code>nested</code></a>-qualifier, and then the
'exactly one qualifier'-case is implemented.
For illustration, the following code defines
<a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a> in terms of
<a href="#do-ec"><code>do-ec</code></a>:
</p>
<blockquote id="fold3-ec-example"><pre>
(define-syntax fold3-ec
  (syntax-rules (nested)
    ((fold3-ec x0 (nested q1 ...) q etc1 etc2 etc3 etc ...)
     (fold3-ec x0 (nested q1 ... q) etc1 etc2 etc3 etc ...) )
    ((fold3-ec x0 q1 q2 etc1 etc2 etc3 etc ...)
     (fold3-ec x0 (nested q1 q2) etc1 etc2 etc3 etc ...) )
    ((fold3-ec x0 expression f1 f2)
     (fold3-ec x0 (nested) expression f1 f2) )

    ((fold3-ec x0 qualifier expression f1 f2)
     (let ((result #f) (empty #t))
       (do-ec qualifier
              (let ((value expression)) ; don't duplicate code

<h3 id="qualifiers">Qualifiers</h3>

<p>
This section defines the syntax <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>.
The nesting of qualifiers is from left (outer) to right (inner).
In other words, the rightmost generator spins fastest.
The nesting also defines the scope of the variables introduced
by the generators.
This implies that inner generators may depend on the variables
of outer generators.
The sequence of enumeration of values is strictly <i>depth first</i>.
These conventions are illustrated by the
first <a href="#example1">example</a>.
</p>
<p>
The syntax <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code> consists of the following alternatives:
</p>


<dl>
<dt><a name="generator"></a>
<code>&lt;generator&gt;</code>
</dt>

<dd>
Enumerates a sequence of bindings of one or more variables.
The scope of the variables starts at the generator and extends
over all subsequent qualifiers and expressions in the comprehension.
The <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code>-syntax is defined in
<a href="#generators">Section "Generators"</a>.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="if"></a>
<code>(if &lt;test&gt;)</code>
</dt>

<dd>
Filters the sequence of bindings by testing if
<code>&lt;test&gt;</code> evaluates to non-<code>#f</code>.
Only for those bindings for which this is the case,
the subsequent qualifiers of the comprehension are evaluated.
</dd>
</dl>

</dt>

<dd>
Abbreviated notations for filters of the form
<code>(if (not &lt;test&gt;))</code>,
<code>(if (and &lt;test&gt;</code>*<code>))</code>, and
<code>(if (or &lt;test&gt;</code>*<code>))</code>.
These represent frequent cases of filters.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="begin"></a>
<code>(begin &lt;sequence&gt;)</code>
</dt>

<dd>
Evaluate <code>&lt;sequence&gt;</code>, consisting of
<code>&lt;command&gt;</code>*<code> &lt;expression&gt;</code>,
once for each binding of the variables defined by the
previous qualifiers in the comprehension.
Using this qualifier, side effects can be inserted
into the body of a comprehension.
</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="nested"></a>
<code>(nested &lt;qualifier&gt;</code>*<code>)</code>
</dt>

<dd>
A syntactic construct to group qualifiers.
The meaning of a qualifier according to the
<code>nested</code>-syntax is the same as
inserting <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>*
into the enclosing comprehension.
This construct can be used to reduce comprehensions with several
qualifiers into a form with exactly one qualifier.
</dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="generators">Generators</h3>
<p>
This section defines the syntax <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code>.
Each generator defines a sequence of bindings through
which one or more variables are run.
The scope of the variables begins after the closing
parenthesis of the generator expression and extends
to the end of the comprehension it is part of.
</p>
<p>
<a name="vars"></a>The variables defined by the generators
are specified using the syntax
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<code>&lt;vars&gt; --&gt; &lt;variable1&gt;</code> [ <code>(index &lt;variable2&gt;)</code> ],</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where <code>&lt;variable1&gt;</code> runs through the values in
the sequence defined by the generator, and the optional
<code>&lt;variable2&gt;</code> is an exact integer-valued
index variable counting the values (starting from 0).
The names of the variables must be distinct.
The following example illustrates the index variable:
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>
(list-ec (: x (index i) "abc") (list x i)) =&gt; ((#\a 0) (#\b 1) (#\c 2))</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Unless defined otherwise, all generators make sure that the
expressions provided for their syntactic arguments are
evaluated exactly once, before enumeration begins.
Moreover, it may be assumed that the generators do not
copy the code provided for their arguments, because that
could lead to exponential growth in code size.
Finally, it is possible to assign a value to the variables
defined by a generator, but the effect of this assignment
is unspecified.
</p>
<p>
The syntax <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> consists of the following alternatives:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name=":"></a>
<code>(: &lt;vars&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg&gt;</code>*<code>)</code>
</dt>

<dd>
<p>
First the expressions <code>&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg&gt;</code>*
are evaluated into <i>a</i>[1] <i>a</i>[2] ... <i>a</i>[<i>n</i>]
and then a global dispatch procedure is used to dispatch on
the number and types of the arguments and run the resulting
generator.

Runs the variables through a sequence defined by <code>&lt;dispatch&gt;</code>

The purpose of <code>:dispatched</code> is implementing
dispatched generators, in particular the predefined dispatching
generator <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
The working of <code>:dispatched</code> is as follows.
First <code>&lt;dispatch&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg&gt;</code>* are evaluated,
resulting in a procedure <i>d</i> (the 'dispatcher') and
the values <i>a</i>[1] <i>a</i>[2] ... <i>a</i>[<i>n</i>].
Then
<code>(</code><i>d</i><code> (list </code><i>a</i>[1] <i>a</i>[2] ... <i>a</i>[<i>n</i>] <code>))</code>
is evaluated, resulting in a value <i>g</i>.
If <i>g</i> is not a procedure then the dispatcher
did not recognize the argument list and an error is raised.
Otherwise the 'generator procedure' <i>g</i> is used
to run <code>&lt;vars&gt;</code> through a sequence of values.
The sequence defined by <i>g</i> is obtained by repeated
evaluation of <code>(</code><i>g</i> <i>empty</i><code>)</code>
until the result is <i>empty</i>.
In other words, <i>g</i> indicates the end of the sequence by
returning its only argument, for which the caller has provided
an object distinct from anything <i>g</i> can produce.
(Generator procedures are state based, they are no such noble things
as streams in the sense of <a href="#SRFI40">SRFI 40</a>.)
</p>
<p id=":generator-proc">
The definition of dispatchers is greatly simplified by the
macro <code>:generator-proc</code> that constructs a generator
procedure from a typed generator.
Let <code>(g var arg1 arg ...)</code> be an instance of
the <code>&lt;generator&gt;</code> syntax, for example an
<a href="#%3Afoo">application-specific typed generator</a>,
with a single variable <code>var</code> and no index variable.
Then
</p>
<blockquote><code>
(:generator-proc (g arg1 arg ...)) =&gt; </code><i>g</i>,</blockquote>
<p>
where the generator procedure <i>g</i> runs through the list
<code>(list-ec (g var arg1 arg ...) var)</code>.
</p>

<p id=":dfoo">
<i>Adding an application-specific dispatching generator</i>.
In order to define a new dispatching generator (say <code>:my</code>)
first a dispatching procedure (say <code>:my-dispatch</code>) is defined.
The dispatcher will be called with a single (!) argument
containing the list of all values to dispatch on.
To enable informative error messages, the dispatcher should
return a descriptive object (e.g. a symbol for the module name)
when it is called with the empty list.
Otherwise (if there is at least one value to dispatch on),
the dispatcher must either return a generator procedure
or <code>#f</code> (= no interest).
As an example, the following skeleton code defines a dispatcher
similar to the initial dispatcher of <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>:
</p>
<pre>
(define (:my-dispatch args)
  (case (length args)
    ((0) 'SRFI-NN)
    ((1) (let ((a1 (car args)))
           (cond
            ((list? a1)
             (:generator-proc (:list a1)) )
            ((string? a1)
             (:generator-proc (:string a1)) )
            <i>...more unary cases...</i>
            (else
             #f ))))
    ((2) (let ((a1 (car args)) (a2 (cadr args)))
           (cond
            ((and (list? a1) (list? a2))
             (:generator-proc (:list a1 a2)) )
            <i>...more binary cases...</i>
            (else
             #f ))))
    <i>...more arity cases...</i>
    (else
     (cond
      ((every?-ec (:list a args) (list? a))
       (:generator-proc (:list (apply append args))) )
      <i>...more large variable arity cases...</i>
      (else
       #f )))))</pre>
<p>
Once the dispatcher has been defined, the following macro
implements the new dispatching generator:
</p>
<pre>
(define-syntax :my
  (syntax-rules (index)
    ((:my cc var (index i) arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var (index i) :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...) )
    ((:my cc var arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...) )))</pre>
<p>
This method of extension yields complete control of the dispatching process.
Other modules can only add cases to <code>:my</code>
if they have access to <code>:my-dispatch</code>.
</p>
<p id=":dfoo-global">
<i>Extending the predefined dispatched generator</i>.
An alternative to adding a new dispatched generators is extending
the predefined generator <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>.
Technically, extending <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> means
installing a new global dispatching procedure using
<a href="#%3A-dispatch-set!"><code>:-dispatch-set!</code></a>
as described above.
</p>
<p id="dispatch-union">
In most cases, however, the already installed dispatcher should
be extended by new cases.
The following procedure is a utility for doing so:
</p>
<pre>(dispatch-union <i>d1</i> <i>d2</i>) =&gt; <i>d</i>,</pre>
<p>
where the new dispatcher <i>d</i> recognizes the union of the
cases recognized by the dispatchers <i>d1</i> and <i>d2</i>.
The new dispatcher always tries both component dispatchers
and raises an error in case of conflict.
The identification returned by <code>(</code><i>d</i><code>)</code>
is the concatenation of the component identifications
<code>(</code><i>d1</i><code>)</code> and
<code>(</code><i>d2</i><code>)</code>, enclosed in lists
if necessary.
For illustration, consider the following code:
</p>
<pre>
(define (example-dispatch args)
  (cond
   ((null? args)
    'example )
   ((and (= (length args) 1) (symbol? (car args)) )
    (:generator-proc (:string (symbol-&gt;string (car args)))) )
   (else
    #f )))

(:-dispatch-set! (dispatch-union (:-dispatch-ref) example-dispatch))</pre>
<p>
After evaluation of this code, the following example will work:
</p>
<pre>(list-ec (: c 'abc) c) =&gt; (#\a #\b #\c)</pre>
<p>
Adding cases to <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> is particularly useful
for frequent cases of interactive input.
Be warned, however, that the advantage of global extension also carries
the danger of conflicts, unexpected side-effects, and slow dispatching.

This generator is for defining other generators.

The generator is a compromise between expressive power
(more flexible loops) and fixed structure (necessary
for merging and modifying generators).
In the fully decorated form, the syntactic variables
<code>&lt;ob&gt;</code> (outer binding),
<code>&lt;oc&gt;</code> (outer command),
<code>&lt;lb&gt;</code> (loop binding),
<code>&lt;ne1?&gt;</code> (not-end1?),

  &lt;oc&gt;*
  (let loop (&lt;lb&gt;*)
    (if &lt;ne1?&gt;
        (let (&lt;ib&gt;*)

          (if &lt;ne2?&gt;
              (loop &lt;ls&gt;*) ))))),</pre>

where <code>&lt;oc&gt;*</code> and
<code>&lt;ic&gt;*</code> are syntactically
equivalent to <code>&lt;command&gt;</code>*,
i.e. they do not begin with a <code>&lt;definition&gt;</code>.
The latter requirement allows the code generator to
produce more efficient code for special cases by
removing empty <code>let</code>-expressions altogether.

The parallel generator terminates when any of its component

Note the distinction between <code>:while</code>, stopping <i>at</i>

<p>
An important aspect of this SRFI is a modular mechanism to
define new typed generators.
To define a new typed generator a hygienic referentially
transparent macro of the same name is defined to transform
the generator pattern into an instance of the
<a href="#%3Ado"><code>:do</code></a>-generator.
The extension is fully modular, meaning that no other
macro has to be modified to add the new generator.
This is achieved by defining the new macro in
<i>Continuation Passing Style</i>, as in <a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>.
</p>
<p>
Technically, this works as follows.
Assume the generator syntax <code>(:mygen &lt;var&gt; &lt;arg&gt;)</code>
is to be implemented, for example running the variable <code>&lt;var&gt;</code>
through the list <code>(reverse &lt;arg&gt;)</code>.
The following definition implements <code>:mygen</code>
in terms of <a href="#%3Alist"><code>:list</code></a>
using the additional syntactic variable <code>cc</code>
(read <i>current continuation</i>):
</p>
<pre>
(define-syntax :mygen
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((:mygen cc var arg)
     (:list cc var (reverse arg)) )))</pre>
<p>
After this definition, any comprehension will accept
the <code>:mygen</code>-generator and produce the
proper code for it.
This works as follows.
When a comprehension sees something of the form
<code>(g arg ...)</code> in the position of a
<code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code> then it will
transform the entire comprehension into
<code>(g (continue ...) arg ...)</code>.
This effectively 'transfers control' to the
macro <code>g</code>, for example <code>:mygen</code>.
The macro <code>g</code> has full control of
the transformation, but eventually it should
transform the expression into
<code>(:do (continue ...) etc ...)</code>.
In the <code>:mygen</code>-example this is done
by the <code>:list</code>-macro.
The macro <code>:do</code> finally transforms
into <code>(continue ... (:do etc ...))</code>.
As <code>continue</code> has been chosen by the
macro implementing the comprehension,
it can regain control and proceed
with other qualifiers.
</p>
<p>
In order to ensure consistency of new generators
with the ones defined in this SRFI, a few conventions
are in order.
Firstly, the generator patterns begin with one or more
variables followed by arguments defining the sequence.
Secondly, each generator except <code>:do</code>
can handle an optional index variable.
This is most easily implemented using
<a href="#%3Aparallel"><code>:parallel</code></a>
together with <a href="#%3Aintegers"><code>:integers</code></a>.
In case the payload generator needs an index anyhow
(e.g. <a href="#%3Avector"><code>:vector</code></a>)
it is more efficient to add an index-variable if
none is given and to implement the indexed case.
Finally, make sure that no syntactic variable of the
generator pattern ever gets duplicated in the code
(to avoid exponential code size in nested application),
and introduce sufficient intermediate variables to
make sure expressions are evaluated at the correct time.

Suggestions for application-specific extensions</h2>

<h3>Arrays in the sense of <a href="#SRFI25">[SRFI25]</a></h3>
<p>
In order to create an array from a sequence of elements,
a comprehension with the following syntax would be useful:
</p>
<pre>(array-ec &lt;shape&gt; &lt;qualifier&gt;* &lt;expression&gt;).</pre>
<p>
The comprehension constructs a new array of the given shape
by filling it row-major with the sequence of elements as specified
by the qualifiers.
</p>
<p>
On the generator side, it would be most useful to have a
generator of the form
</p>
<pre>(:array &lt;vars&gt; &lt;arg&gt;),</pre>
<p>
running through the elements of the array in row-major.
For the optional index variable, the extension
<code>(index &lt;k1&gt; &lt;k&gt;</code>*<code>)</code>
could be defined where <code>&lt;k1&gt; &lt;k&gt;</code>*
are variable names indexing the various dimensions.
</p>

<h3>Random Numbers in the sense of <a href="#SRFI27">[SRFI27]</a></h3>
<p>
In order to create a vector or list of random numbers,
it would be convenient to have generators of the following form:
</p>
<pre>
(:random-integer [ &lt;range&gt; [ &lt;number&gt; ] ] )
(:random-real &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ &lt;number&gt; ] )</pre>
<p>
where <code>&lt;range&gt;</code> (default 2) indicates the range of
the integers and <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> (default infinity)
specifies how many elements are to be generated.
Derived from these basic generators, one could define several
other generators for other distributions (e.g. Gaussian).
</p>

<h3>Bitstrings in the sense of <a href="#SRFI33">[SRFI33]</a></h3>
<p>
As eager comprehensions are efficient, they can be useful
for operations involving strings of bits.
It could be useful to have the following comprehension:
</p>
<pre>(bitwise-ec &lt;qualifier&gt;* &lt;expression&gt;),</pre>
<p>
which constructs an integer from bits obtained as values
of <code>&lt;expression&gt;</code> in the ordering defined
by <a href="#SRFI33">[SRFI33]</a>.
In other words, if the sequence of values is
<i>x</i>[0], <i>x</i>[1], ..., <i>x</i>[<i>n</i>-1] then
the result is <i>x</i>[0] + <i>x</i>[1] 2 + ... + <i>x</i>[<i>n</i>-1] 2^(<i>n</i>-1).
On the generator side, a generator of the form
</p>
<pre>(:bitwise &lt;vars&gt; &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg&gt;*)</pre>
<p>
runs through the sequence of bits obtained by appending the
binary digits of the integers <code>&lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg&gt;</code>*.
</p>
<h3><a name="srfi40-ec"></a>Streams in the sense of <a href="#SRFI40">[SRFI 40]</a></h3>

<p>
It is possible to 'lazify' the eager comprehension
<a href="#list-ec"><code>list-ec</code></a>,
constructing a stream in the sense of <a href="#SRFI40">[SRFI 40]</a>.
Clearly, such a comprehension (<code>stream-ec</code>)
is not eager at all since it only runs the loops when results are requested.
It is also possible to define a <code>:stream</code>-generator with
the same API as <a href="#%3Alist"><code>:list</code></a> but running
through streams instead of lists.
</p>
<p>
For what it is worth,
the file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/srfi40-ec.scm">srfi40-ec.scm</a> implements
<code>:stream</code> and <code>stream-ec</code> and gives an example.
The implementation makes substantial use of
<code>call-with-current-continuation</code> to run the loop
only when necessary.
In some implementations of Scheme this may involve
considerable overhead.
</p>

<h3>Reading Text Files</h3>
<p>
Eager comprehensions can also be used to process files.
However, bear in mind that an eager comprehension wants
to read and process the entire file right away.
Nevertheless, these generators would be useful for
reading through the lines of a file or through the
characters of a file:
</p>
<pre>
(:lines-of-file &lt;vars&gt; &lt;file&gt;)
(:chars-of-file &lt;vars&gt; [ (line &lt;variable1&gt;) ] [ (column &lt;variable2&gt;) ] &lt;file&gt;)</pre>
<p>
Here <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> is either an input port
or a string interpreted as a filename.
In a similar fashion, generators reading from sockets defined
by URLs or other communication facilities could be defined.
</p>

<h3>The Scheme shell <a href="#SCSH">Scsh</a></h3>
<p>
In the Scheme-shell Scsh it could be useful to have certain
comprehensions and generators.
Candidates for comprehensions are
<code>begin-ec</code>,
<code>|-ec</code>,
<code>||-ec</code>, and
<code>&amp;&amp;-ec</code>.
Concerning generators, it might be useful to have
<code>:directory</code> running through the
records of a directory, and maybe a
sophisticated <code>:file-match</code>-generator
could enumerate file record in a directory structure.
Optional variables of the generators could give
convenient access frequent components of the file records
(e.g. the filename).
Another candidate is <code>:env</code> to run through
the environment associations.
It is left to other authors and other SRFIs to
define a useful set of comprehensions and generators
for Scsh.
</p>

<h2 id="design">Design Rationale</h2>

<h3>What is the difference between eager and lazy comprehensions?</h3>
<p>
A lazy comprehension, for example <code>stream-of</code> in the
sense of <a href="#SRFI40">[SRFI 40]</a>, constructs an object
representing a sequence of values.
Only at the time these values are needed that they
are actually produced.
An eager comprehension, on the other hand, is an instruction to
run through a certain sequence of values and do something with it,
for example as in <a href="#do-ec"><code>do-ec</code></a>.
In other words, it is nothing more sophisticated than a loop,
potentially with a more convenient notation.
This also explains why <code>stream-of</code> is the most
fundamental <i>lazy</i> comprehension, and all others can
be formulated in terms of it, whereas the most fundamental
<i>eager</i> comprehension is <code>do-ec</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="convention">Why the [<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>]
order of qualifiers?</h3>
<p>
In principle, there are six possible orders in which the
qualifiers and the expression of a comprehension can be written.
We denote the different conventions with a pattern in which
<i>expr</i> denotes the expression over which the comprehension
ranges, <i>inner</i> denotes the generator spinning fastest, and
<i>outer</i> denotes the generator spinning slowest.
For example, <a href="#Haskell">[Haskell]</a> and
<a href="#Python">[Python]</a> use
[<i>expr</i> | <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i>].
(Probably with sufficient persistence, instances for any
of the conventions can be found on the Internet.)
In addition, there is the common mathematical notation
'{<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>) | <i>x</i> in <i>X</i>}'.
</p>
<p>
It is important to understand that the notational convention
does not only determine the order of enumeration but also the
scope of the variables introduced by the generators.
The scope of <i>inner</i> includes <i>expr</i>, and the
scope of <i>outer</i> should include <i>inner</i> to allow
inner generates depending on outer generators.
Eventually, the choice for a particular syntactic convention is
largely a matter of personal preferences.
However, there are a few considerations that went into the
choice made for this SRFI:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
The mathematical notation is universally known and widely used.
However, the mathematical notation denotes a <i>set</i> comprehension
in which the order of the qualifiers is either irrelevant or must
be deduced from the context.
For the purpose of eager comprehensions as a programming language
construct, the order does matter and a simple convention is a plus.
For these reasons, the mathematical notation as such is undesirable,
but its widespread use is in favor of
[<i>expr</i> | <i>inner</i> .. <i>outer</i>] and
[<i>expr</i> | <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i>].
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
It is desirable to have the scope of the variables increase
into one direction, as in
[<i>expr</i> | <i>inner</i> .. <i>outer</i>] and
[<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>], and
not change direction, as in
[<i>expr</i> | <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i>]
where <i>expr</i> is in the scope of <i>inner</i>
but <i>outer</i> is not.
This is even more important if the syntax in Scheme
does not explicitly contain the '|'-separator.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
More complicated comprehensions with several nested generators
eventually look like nested loops and Scheme always
introduces them <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> as in
<code>do</code> and named-<code>let</code>.
This is in favor of
[<i>expr</i> | <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i>] and
[<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>].
Shorter comprehension may look more naturally the
other way around.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Regarding these contradicting preferences, I regard
linearity in scoping (2.) most important, followed by
readability for more complicated comprehensions (3.).
This leads to [<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>].
An example in Scheme-syntax is
<code>(list-ec (: x 10) (: y x) (f x y))</code>,
which looks acceptable to me even without similarity
to the mathematical notation.
As a downside, the convention clashes with other the
convention used in other languages (e.g. Haskell and Python).
</p>

<h3>You forgot [<i>choose your favorite here</i>]-ec!</h3>
<p>
I tried to construct a reasonably useful set of tools
according to what <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a> specifies.
Nevertheless, is the choice what to include and what to
leave out eventually a matter of personal preference.</p><p>
</p>
<p>
When 'packing the toolbox' I went for travelling light;
this SRFI does not include everything imaginable
or even everything useful.
I oriented myself at the standard procedures
of <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a>,
with a few omissions and additions.
A notable omission are <code>gcd-ec</code> and
<code>lcm-ec</code> because they are one-liners,
and more severely, of questionable value in practice.
A notable addition are
<a href="#fold-ec"><code>fold-ec</code></a> and
<a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a>,
providing a mechanism to define lots of useful one-liners.
The other notable addition is
<a href="#first-ec"><code>first-ec</code></a>, which
is the fundamental 'early stopping' comprehension.
It is used to define
<a href="#any%3F-ec"><code>any?-ec</code></a> and
<a href="#every%3F-ec"><code>every?-ec</code></a>
which are among the most frequent comprehensions.
</p>
<p>
Concerning the generators, the same principle has been used.
Additions include <a href="#%3Arange"><code>:range</code></a>
and friends because they are universally needed, and
<a href="#%3Adispatched"><code>:dispatched</code></a> which is
primarily intended for implementing <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>.
</p>

<h3 id="dovetail">Why is the order of enumeration specified?</h3>
<p>
For the purpose of this SRFI, every generator runs through
its sequence of bindings in a well specified order, and nested
generators run through the Cartesian product in the order
of nested loops.
The purpose of this definition is making the sequence as
easily predictable as possible.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, many mechanisms for <i>lazy</i> comprehensions
do not specify the order in which the elements are enumerated.
When it comes to infinite streams, this has the great advantage
that a comprehension may interleave an inner and an outer
enumeration, a method also known as 'dove-tailing' or 'diagonalizing'.
Interleaving ensures that any value of the resulting stream is
produced after a finite amount of time, even if one or more
inner streams are infinite.
</p>

<h3>Why both typed and dispatching generators?</h3>
<p>
The reason for typed generators is runtime efficiency.
In fact, the code produced by <code>:range</code> and others
will run as fast as a hand-coded <code>do</code>-loop.
The primary purpose of the dispatching generator is convenience.
It comes at the price of reduced runtime performance,
both for loop iteration and startup.
</p>

<h3>Why the <i>something</i><code>-ec</code> and <code>:</code><i>type</i> naming?</h3>
<p>
The purpose of the <code>:</code><i>type</i> convention is to keep
many common comprehensions down to one-liners.
In my opinion, the fundamental nature of eager comprehensions
justifies a single character naming convention.
The <i>something</i><code>-ec</code> convention is primarily intended to
stay away from the widely used <i>something</i><code>-of</code>.
It reduces confusion and conflict with related mechanisms.
</p>

<h3>Why combine variable binding and sequence definition?</h3>
<p>
The generators of this SRFI do two different things with
a single syntactic construct: They define a sequence of values
to enumerate and they specify a variable (within a certain
scope) to run through that sequence.
An alternative is to separate the two, for example as it
has been done in
<a href="srfi-40.html">SRFI 40</a>.
</p>
<p>
The reason for combining sequence definition and enumeration
for the purpose of this SRFI is threefold.
Firstly, sequences of values are not explicitly represented as
objects in the typed generators; the generators merely
manipulate an internal state.
Secondly, this SRFI aims at a most concise notation for
common comprehensions and reduces syntax to the naked minimum.
Thirdly, this SRFI aims at the highest possible performance for
typed generators, which is achieved if the state being manipulated
is represented by the loop variable itself.
</p>

<h3>Why is <code>(: &lt;vars&gt;)</code> illegal?</h3>
<p>
It is reasonable and easy to define <code>(<a href="#%3A">:</a> &lt;vars&gt;)</code>
as <code>(<a href="#%3Aintegers">:integers</a> &lt;vars&gt;)</code>,
enumerating the non-negative integers.
However, it turned out that a frequent mistake in using the
eager comprehensions is to forget either the variable
or an argument for the enumeration.
As this would lead to an infinite loop (not always
equally pleasant in interactive sessions), it is not allowed.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no <code>:sequential</code>?</h3>
<p>
Just like <a href="#%3Aparallel"><code>:parallel</code></a>
enumerates generators in
parallel, a <code>:sequential</code> generator could
enumerate a concatenation of several generator, starting
the next one when the previous has finished.
The reason for not having such a qualifier is
that the generators should use all the same variable name
and there is no hygienic and referentially transparent
way of enforcing this (or even knowing the variable).
</p>

<h3>Why is there no general <code>let</code>-qualifier?</h3>
<p>
It is easy to add <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>,
and <code>letrec</code> as cases to <code>&lt;qualifier&gt;</code>.
This would allow more sophisticated local variables
and expressions than possible with
<code>(<a href="#%3Alet">:let</a> &lt;vars&gt; &lt;expression&gt;)</code> and
<code>(<a href="#begin">begin</a> &lt;sequence&gt;</code>*<code>)</code>.
In particular, a local <code>&lt;definition&gt;</code>
in the sense of <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 7.1.5.]</a> would
be possible.
</p>
<p>
There are two reasons for not including <code>let</code>
and friends as qualifiers.
The first reason concerns readability.
A qualifier of the form
<code>(let (&lt;binding spec&gt;</code>*<code>) &lt;body&gt;)</code>
only makes sense if the scope of the new variables ends at the
end of the comprehension, and <i>not</i> already
after <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
The similarity with ordinary <code>let</code>-expressions
would be very confusing.
The second reason concerns the design rationale.
If sophisticated <code>let</code>-qualifiers involving
recursion or local definitions are needed, it is likely
that eager comprehensions are being overused.
In that case it might be better to define a procedure
for the task.
So including an invitation to overuse the mechanism would
be a serious violation of the
<i>Keep It Simple and Stupid</i> principle.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no <code>:nested</code> generator?</h3>
<p>
The specification above defines <a href="#nested"><code>nested</code></a>
as a qualifier but <a href="#%3Aparallel"><code>:parallel</code></a>
as a generator.
In particular, this makes it impossible to make parallel
generators from nested ones.
</p>
<p>
This design simply reflects an implementability limitation.
All component generators of <code>:parallel</code> are
transformed into <a href="#%3Ado"><code>:do</code></a>-generators
and these can be merged into a parallel generator.
However, nested generators cannot be merged easily without
losing the type of the generator,
which would seriously hurt modularity and performance.
</p>

<h3>Is <code>any?-ec</code> eager?</h3>
<p>
Yes, it is still eager because it immediately starts to
run through the sequence.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the reference implementation makes sure
<a href="#first-ec"><code>first-ec</code></a>,
<a href="#any%3F-ec"><code>any?-ec</code></a>, and
<a href="#every%3F-ec"><code>every?-ec</code></a>
execute efficiently so they can be used conveniently
as in
<code>(every?-ec (:list x my-list) (pred? x))</code>.
</p>

<h3>Why this whole <code>:dispatched</code> business?</h3>
<p>
It is specified above that <i>the</i> dispatching generator,
called <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>, is just a special case
of <a href="#%3Adispatched"><code>:dispatched</code></a> using
a global dispatching procedure.
Alternatively, a simple fixed global mechanism to extend
<a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> could have been used.
This is much simpler but does not support the definition
of new dispatched generators.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of <a href="#%3Adispatched"><code>:dispatched</code></a>
and its utilities
(<a href="#%3Agenerator-proc"><code>:generator-proc</code></a> and
<a href="#dispatch-union"><code>dispatch-union</code></a>)
is the following.
Assume <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> is to be used inside a
module but it is essential that no other module can spoil it,
e.g. by installing a very slow dispatcher.
The recommended way to proceed in this case is to define a
local copy of the original dispatching generator
<a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>,
for example with the following code
</p>
<pre>
(define :my-dispatch
  (make-initial-:-dispatch) )

(define-syntax :my
  (syntax-rules (index)
    ((:my cc var (index i) arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var (index i) :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...) )
    ((:my cc var arg1 arg ...)
     (:dispatched cc var :my-dispatch arg1 arg ...) ))),</pre>
<p>
and to use the new generator <code>:my</code> instead of
<a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
An alternative for the dispatching mechanism as defined in
this SRFI is the use of parameter objects in the sense of
<a href="#SRFI39">[SRFI 39]</a>.
The dispatching generator would then access a dynamically
scoped variable to find the dispatcher, allowing full
control over dispatching.
However, this approach does not solve the dilemma that it is
sometimes useful that <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> is global
and sometimes undesired.
The approach specified for this SRFI addresses this dilemma
by offering options.
</p>
<p>
Another alternative for dealing with the dispatching
problem is adding an optional argument to the syntax of
<a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> through which the dispatcher
can be passed explicitly.
However, as <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a> has variable
arity and the identifier for the variable cannot be
distinguished from any value for a dispatcher,
this is syntactically problematic.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no local mechanism for adding to <a href="#%3A"><code>:</code></a>?</h3>
<p>
According to <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 7.1.6.]</a> macros can only
be defined at the level of the <code>&lt;program&gt;</code> syntax.
This implies that the scope of typed generators cannot easily be
limited to local scopes.
As typed and dispatched generators go together,
there is also no strong need for a limited scope
of dispatched generators either.
Furthermore, locally extendable dispatchers are another major
headache to those trying to understand other people's code.
</p>

<h3>Why are dispatchers unary?</h3>
<p>
As defined in <a href="#%3Adispatched"><code>:dispatched</code></a>,
a dispatching procedure is called with a single argument being
the list of values to dispatch on.
An alternative is to <code>apply</code> the dispatcher to the
list of values to dispatch on, which would be more natural in Scheme.
</p>
<p>
The reason for not using <code>apply</code> is a minor
improvement in efficiency.
Every time <code>apply</code> is used on a procedure of variable
arity, an object containing the argument list is allocated on
the heap.
As a dispatcher may call many other dispatchers, this will adds
to the overhead of dispatching, which is relevant in inner loops.
</p>

<h3>Why are there two fold comprehensions?</h3>
<p>
The reason for having two fold comprehensions
(<a href="#fold-ec"><code>fold-ec</code></a> and
<a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a>) is efficiency.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, the more general construction is
<a href="#fold3-ec"><code>fold3-ec</code></a>
as it allows individual treatment of the empty
sequence case and the singleton sequence case.
However, this comes at the price of more book-keeping
as can be seen from the
<a href="#fold3-ec-example">implementation example</a>.
As the overhead is located within inner loops,
it makes sense to define another fold comprehension
for the case where the added flexibility is not needed.
This is <a href="#fold-ec"><code>fold-ec</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
The names <code>fold-ec</code> and <code>fold3-ec</code>
have been chosen for the comprehensions in order to stay
clear any other 'fold' that may be around.
</p>

<h3>Why is <code>:char-range</code> not defined by <code>integer-&gt;char</code>?</h3>
<p>
The definition of <a href="#%3Achar-range"><code>:char-range</code></a>
specifies a sequence of adjacent characters ordered by <code>char&lt;=?</code>.
The reason for not using <code>char-&gt;integer</code> and
<code>integer-&gt;char</code> is the fact that
<a href="#R5RS">[R5RS, 6.3.4.]</a> leaves it to the implementation
whether the integers representing characters are consecutive or not.
In effect, this underspecification is inherited by <code>:char-range</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="related-work">Related Work and Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>
Several other proposals related to the mechanism specified here exists.
The following mechanisms are made for and in Scheme (or at least a
specific dialect thereof):
</p>
<p>
First of all, the report <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a> of Scheme itself
defines two constructs for writing loops: <code>do</code> and
named-<code>let</code>.
Both constructs express a single loop (not nested),
possibly with several variables running in parallel,
based on explicit manipulation of the state variables.
For example <code>(do ((x 0 (+ x 1))) ((= x 10)) (display x))</code>
explicitly mentions how to obtain the next binding of <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>
Richard Kelsey's "Macros for writing loops", <a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>
are an extension to Scheme48 to simplify the formulation of loops.
The basic idea is to stick with a <code>do</code>-like syntax for
more sophisticated loop constructs, not necessarily manipulating
a state variable explicitly.
For example, <code>(list* x '(1 2 3))</code> expresses an enumeration
of the variable <code>x</code> through the list <code>(1 2 3)</code>
without explicit state manipulation.
The iteration constructs of <a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>, named
<code>iterate</code> and <code>reduce</code>,
express a single (not nested) loop (<code>iterate</code>) or
comprehension (<code>reduce</code>) with any number of
parallel enumerations.
A most important feature of the <a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>-concept
is a modular way to add sequence types (generators).
In effect, the addition of a new sequence type does not
require a modification of the existing macros.
This is achieved by carefully limiting the expressive
power of the loop constructs and by using the macros
in <i>Continuation Passing Style</i> to call other macros.
The <a href="#MWL">[MWL]</a>-concept, and its implementation,
were most influential for this SRFI.
</p>
<p>
Another related mechanism is the library of streams recently
submitted by Phil L. Bewig as <a href="#SRFI40">[SRFI 40]</a>.
The library contains a data type to represent even
streams (both car and cdr potentially delayed) and
defines procedures for manipulating these streams.
Moreover, the macro <code>stream-of</code> defines a
lazy comprehension resulting in the stream of values of
an expression subject to generators and filters.
A fixed set of generators (lists, vector, string, port,
and naturally: streams) is supported; extending the
list of generators requires changing <code>stream-of</code>.
Nevertheless, modularity is high since it is easy to define
a procedure producing a stream object and this can be
used for enumeration.
The order of enumeration is left unspecified to allow
interleaving of generators (also refer to
<a href="#dovetail">above</a>.)
Before Phil submitted his SRFIs, we had a short
discussion in which we clarified the semantic and syntactic
differences of our approaches.
It turned out that the mechanisms are sufficiently
different not to unify them.
The most important difference is the design rationale:
Phil created his library to support the stream-paradigm
in Scheme, inspired by the work done for Haskell and
other lazy languages, and intrigued by the beauty
of programming with infinite streams.
My work only aims at a convenient way of expressing
frequent patterns of loops in a compact way.
For what it is worth, section <a href="#srfi40-ec">SRFI40-ec</a>
contains a suggestion for extending the eager comprehension
mechanism for SRFI40-streams.

triggered Eli Barzilay to implement a library of eager
comprehensions for PLT-Scheme, <a href="#Eli">[Eli]</a>.
The mechanism implemented by Eli is in essence very
similar to the one proposed in this SRFI, and the two
efforts have been independent until recently.
Syntactically, Eli uses infix operators for generators,
whereas this SRFI is purely prefix, and Eli uses the
[<i>expr</i> | <i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i>] convention
for nesting, whereas this SRFI uses the
[<i>outer</i> .. <i>inner</i> | <i>expr</i>]
<a href="#convention">convention</a>.
Semantically, Eli's mechanism defines more flexible
loops than this SRFI.
Comprehensions are regarded as generalized collection
processes like fold and reduce.
The mechanism in this SRFI is more restricted with respect
to control flow (there is no general <code>while</code>)
and more extensive with respect to generators and
comprehensions.
Despite the strong conceptual similarity, the design
rationales are different.
This SRFI focuses on portability and modular extension,
whatever that may cost in terms of expressive power.
</p>
<p>
Finally, I would like to thank Mike Sperber for his
encouragement to proceed with the SRFI and for several
discussions of the matter.
In particular, the dispatching mechanism evolved
rapidly during discussions with Mike.
</p>

<h2 id="refimpl">Implementation</h2>
<p>
The reference implementation focuses on portability,
performance, readability and simplicity, roughly in this order.
It is written in <a href="#R5RS">[R5RS]</a>-Scheme
(including macros) extended by <a href="#SRFI23">[SRFI 23]</a>
(<code>error</code>).
The reference implementation was developed
under <a href="#Scheme48">Scheme48</a> (0.57),
<a href="#PLT">PLT</a> (202, 204), and
<a href="#SCM">SCM</a> (5d7).
</p>
<p>
The file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/ec.scm">ec.scm</a> is the source of
the reference implementation.
It also contains comments concerning potential problems.
Implementors might find the file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/design.scm">design.scm</a>
helpful.
It contains alternative implementations of certain comprehensions
and generators in order to simplify tuning the implementation
of this SRFI for different Scheme systems.
</p>
<p>
The file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/examples.scm">examples.scm</a> contains a
collection of examples, and some code checking their results.
The purpose of most examples is detecting implementation errors,
but the section 'Less artificial examples' contains a few
real-world examples.
</p>
<p>
The file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/timing.scm">timing.scm</a> contains some
code to measure an idea of performance of the comprehensions.
A hand-coded <code>do</code>-loop, the typed generator
<code>(<a href="#%3Arange">:range</a> </code><i>n</i><code>)</code>,
and the dispatching generator
<code>(<a href="#%3A">:</a> </code><i>n</i><code>)</code>
are compared.
For each loop we compare the time needed
per iteration and the time needed to construct the loop (the startup delay).
As a rule of thumb, <code>:range</code> is as fast (or slightly faster)
as a hand-coded <code>do</code>-loop per iteration and needs about a
third more time for startup (due to type checking of the argument).
The dispatching generator needs about twice the time per iteration
(due to calling the generator procedure) and needs about five times
as long for startup (due to dispatching).
</p>
<p>
The file <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-42/extension.scm">extension.scm</a> contains
examples for adding new generators and comprehensions.
