<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This SRFI defines <i>parameter</i> objects, the procedure
<code>make-parameter</code> to
create parameter objects and the <code>parameterize</code> special
form to dynamically bind parameter objects.  In the dynamic
environment, each parameter object is bound to a cell containing the
value of the parameter.  When a procedure is called the called
procedure inherits the dynamic environment from the caller.  The
<code>parameterize</code> special form allows the binding of a
parameter object to be changed for the dynamic extent of its body.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
The <i>dynamic environment</i> is the structure which allows
the system to find the value returned by the R5RS procedures
<code>current-input-port</code> and <code>current-output-port</code>.
The R5RS procedures <code>with-input-from-file</code> and
<code>with-output-to-file</code> extend the dynamic environment to
produce a new dynamic environment which is in effect for the dynamic
extent of the call to the thunk passed as their last argument.  These
procedures are essentially special purpose dynamic binding operations
on hidden dynamic variables (one for <code>current-input-port</code>
and one for <code>current-output-port</code>).  The purpose of this
SRFI is to generalize this dynamic binding mechanism (which exists in
all R5RS compliant systems) to allow the user to introduce new dynamic
variables and dynamically bind them.
</p>

<p>
General dynamic binding mechanisms exist in several implementations of
Scheme under various names, including "fluid" variables and parameter
objects.  The parameter objects specified in this SRFI are compatible
with the semantics of all implementations of Scheme we know which
currently support parameter objects (in the sense that it is possible
to implement this SRFI so that old code works the same as before).  We
believe Chez-Scheme was the first implementation of Scheme to have
used parameter objects.
</p>

<p>
In the presence of threads, the dynamic binding mechanism does not
behave the same way in all implementations of Scheme supporting
dynamic binding.  The issue is the relationship between the dynamic
environments of the parent and child threads when a thread is created.
In Scheme 48 the child gets a fresh dynamic environment where
(typically but not necessarily) all the bindings are to their initial
value.  In MzScheme and Gambit-C the child is given a dynamic
environment inherited from the parent.  In this inherited dynamic
environment the dynamic variables have the same values as the parent's
dynamic environment.  However, in MzScheme the cells bound to the
dynamic variables in the child are distinct from those of the parent
(i.e. an assignment of a value to a dynamic variable is not visible in
the other thread).  In Gambit-C the child and parent dynamic
environment share the same cells (i.e. an assignment of a value to a
dynamic variable is visible in the other thread).  Note that in the
absence of assignment to dynamic variables the MzScheme and Gambit-C
approaches are equivalent.
</p>

<p>
Given that there are semantic differences in the presence of threads
and that there are valid reasons for choosing each semantics, this
SRFI does not specify the semantics of parameter objects in the
presence of threads.  It is left to the implementation and other SRFIs
which extend this SRFI to specify the interaction between parameter
objects and threads.
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>
The <i>dynamic environment</i> is composed of two parts: the <i>local
dynamic environment</i> and the <i>global dynamic environment</i>.
The global dynamic environment is used to lookup parameter objects
that can't be found in the local dynamic environment.  When parameter
objects are created, their initial binding is put in the global
dynamic environment (by mutation).  The local dynamic environment is
only extended by the <code>parameterize</code> form.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parameter objects</i> are created with the
<code>make-parameter</code> procedure which takes one or two
arguments.  The second argument is a one argument <i>conversion
procedure</i>.  If only one argument is passed to
<code>make-parameter</code> the identity function is used as a
conversion procedure.  The global dynamic environment is updated to
associate the parameter object to a new cell.  The initial content of
the cell is the result of applying the conversion procedure to the
first argument of <code>make-parameter</code>.
</p>

<p>
A <i>parameter object</i> is a procedure which accepts zero or one
argument.  The cell bound to a particular parameter object in the
dynamic environment is accessed by calling the parameter object.  When
no argument is passed, the content of the cell is returned.  When one
argument is passed the content of the cell is updated with the result
of applying the parameter object's conversion procedure to the
argument.
</p>

<p>
The <code>parameterize</code> special form, when given a parameter
object and a value, binds for the dynamic extent of its body the
parameter object to a new cell.  The initial content of the cell is
the result of applying the parameter object's conversion procedure to
the value.  The <code>parameterize</code> special form behaves
analogously to <code>let</code> when binding more than one parameter
object (that is the order of evaluation is unspecified and the new
bindings are only visible in the body of the <code>parameterize</code>
special form).
</p>

<p>
Note that the conversion procedure can be used for guaranteeing the
type of the parameter object's binding and/or to perform some
conversion of the value.
</p>

<p>
Because it is possible to implement the R5RS procedures
<code>current-input-port</code> and <code>current-output-port</code>
as parameter objects and this offers added functionnality, it is
required by this SRFI that they be implemented as parameter objects
created with <code>make-parameter</code>.
</p>

<h4>Procedures and syntax</h4>

<dl>

<dt id="make-parameter"><pre>
(make-parameter <i>init</i> [<i>converter</i>])                     ;procedure
</pre></dt><dd>

<p>
Returns a new parameter object which is bound in the global dynamic
environment to a cell containing the value returned by the call
<code>(<i>converter</i> <i>init</i>)</code>.  If the conversion
procedure <i>converter</i> is not specified the identity function is
used instead.
</p>

<p>
The parameter object is a procedure which accepts zero or one
argument.  When it is called with no argument, the content of the cell
bound to this parameter object in the current dynamic environment is
returned.  When it is called with one argument, the content of the
cell bound to this parameter object in the current dynamic environment
is set to the result of the call <code>(<i>converter</i>
<i>arg</i>)</code>, where <i>arg</i> is the argument passed to the
parameter object, and an unspecified value is returned.
</p>

<pre>
    (define radix
      (make-parameter 10))

    (define write-shared
      (make-parameter
        #f
        (lambda (x)
          (if (boolean? x)
              x
              (error "only booleans are accepted by write-shared")))))

    (radix)           ==&gt;  10
    (radix 2)
    (radix)           ==&gt;  2
    (write-shared 0)  gives an error

    (define prompt
      (make-parameter
        123
        (lambda (x)
          (if (string? x)
              x
              (with-output-to-string (lambda () (write x)))))))

    (prompt)       ==&gt;  "123"
    (prompt "&gt;")
    (prompt)       ==&gt;  "&gt;"
</pre>
</dd>
<dt id="parameterize"><pre>
(parameterize ((<i>expr1</i> <i>expr2</i>) ...) <i>&lt;body&gt;</i>)             ;syntax
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>

<p>
    The expressions <i>expr1</i> and <i>expr2</i> are evaluated in an
    unspecified order.  The value of the <i>expr1</i> expressions must
    be parameter objects.  For each <i>expr1</i> expression and in an
    unspecified order, the local dynamic environment is extended with
    a binding of the parameter object <i>expr1</i> to a new cell whose
    content is the result of the call <code>(<i>converter</i>
    <i>val</i>)</code>, where <i>val</i> is the value of <i>expr2</i>
    and <i>converter</i> is the conversion procedure of the parameter
    object.  The resulting dynamic environment is then used for the
    evaluation of <i>&lt;body&gt;</i> (which refers to the R5RS grammar
    nonterminal of that name).  The result(s) of the
    <code>parameterize</code> form are the result(s) of the
    <i>&lt;body&gt;</i>.
</p>

<pre>
    (radix)                                              ==&gt;  2
    (parameterize ((radix 16)) (radix))                  ==&gt;  16
    (radix)                                              ==&gt;  2

    (define (f n) (number-&gt;string n (radix)))

    (f 10)                                               ==&gt;  "1010"
    (parameterize ((radix 8)) (f 10))                    ==&gt;  "12"
    (parameterize ((radix 8) (prompt (f 10))) (prompt))  ==&gt;  "1010"
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
The following implementation uses association lists to represent local
dynamic environments.  The global dynamic environment binding is
stored in the parameter object itself.  Since we are assuming that
there is a single thread, the current local dynamic environment can be
bound to a global variable, <code>dynamic-env-local</code>.  Mutations
of this variable are wrapped in a <code>dynamic-wind</code> so that
the local dynamic environment returns to its previous value when
control exits the body of the <code>parameterize</code>.
