<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This SRFI describes a configuration language to be used for specifying
the set of Scheme features or extensions required to run a program.
In addition to a list of required features, a program may also contain
Scheme code to be used only when a particular feature or combination of
features is available.
</p>

<p>
The configuration language is entirely distinct from Scheme; it is
neither embedded in Scheme nor includes Scheme as a subset.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
The use of a separate configuration language makes it easy for
both human and machine readers to determine the requirements of a
program.  It also avoids ambiguities arising from having to expand
macros to determine which features, and thus which macros, are used
in the program.
</p>

<p> See <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-0/">SRFI 0</a> for a
rationale for the need for some kind of configuration control.
</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

     | (<span id="not">not</span> &lt;feature requirement&gt;)

 &lt;feature identifier&gt;
   --&gt; a symbol which is the name of a SRFI
</pre>

<h3>Semantics</h3>
<p>
The configuration language is distinct from Scheme.  Given a set of
available features a <code>&lt;program&gt;</code> can be converted into a
sequence of Scheme commands, definitions, and syntax definitions.
This conversion does not require expanding macros or doing any other
processing of Scheme code.
</p>

<p>
An implementation of the configuration language will need to provide
some method for executing a program.  For example, it might have a
<code>(LOAD-PROGRAM &lt;filename&gt;)</code> function or a compiler that
compiles a program into an executable file.
</p>

<p> The meanings of the different <code>&lt;program&gt;</code> clauses are
given below.  The ordering of the clauses in a <code>&lt;program&gt;</code>
determines the order of the forms in the resultant Scheme program.

</p><p> In processing the <code>REQUIRES</code> and
<code>FEATURE-COND</code> clauses in a <code>&lt;program&gt;</code>,
an implementation should be consistent with some fixed set of present
and absent features.  An implementation may analyze a <code>&lt;program&gt;</code>
before choosing a set of features to use in processing it, but it
should not use different sets of features for different clauses in the
same <code>&lt;program&gt;</code>.
</p>

<dl>
      <dt><code>(requires &lt;feature-identifier&gt;+)</code></dt>
      <dd>The listed features are required by the program.  If one or
	more is not provided by the implementation the program cannot
	be run.
      </dd>
      
    <dt><code>(files &lt;filename&gt;*)</code></dt>
  <dd>The listed files are read and the forms they contain added to the program.</dd>

    <dt><code>(code &lt;body&gt;)</code></dt>
  <dd>The forms in &lt;body&gt; are added to the program.</dd>

    <dt><code>(feature-cond &lt;feature-cond clause&gt;+)</code></dt>
      <dd>
<p>
        The meaning of a <code>FEATURE-COND</code> clause is that of the
<code>&lt;program-clause&gt;</code>s in the first <code>&lt;feature-cond clause&gt;</code> whose
<code>&lt;implementation-requirement&gt;</code> is satisfied by the implementation.
If an <code>ELSE</code> clause is present it is used if and only if no preceding
clause is satisfied; a <code>FEATURE-COND</code> with an
<code>ELSE</code> clause is always satisfied.
</p>
<p>If no clause can be satisfied the <code>&lt;program&gt;</code> cannot be evaluated in
the implementation.</p>

	<p>
The meaning of the <code>&lt;implementation requirement&gt;</code>s is as follows:</p>

	<table>
	  <tr><td><code>&lt;feature identifier&gt;</code></td><td>satisfied if the feature is present</td>
	  </tr>

	  <tr><td><code>(and)</code></td><td>always satisfied</td>
	  </tr>

	<tr><td><code>(and x ...)</code></td><td>satisfied if every
	<code>X</code> is satisfied</td>
	    </tr>

	<tr><td><code>(or)</code></td><td>never satisfied</td></tr>

	<tr><td><code>(or x ...)</code></td><td>satisfied if any
	<code>X</code> is satisfied</td></tr>

	  <tr><td><code>(not x)</code></td><td>satisfied if <code>X</code> is not satisfied</td></tr>
	</table>
      </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p> Two implementations are provided here.  The first is a
<code>PROCESS-PROGRAM</code> function that converts a
<code>&lt;program&gt;</code>, represented as an S-expression, and a
list of feature identifiers and returns the list expressions,
definitions, and syntax definitions that are the source for the
<code>&lt;program&gt;</code> in the presence of those features.  The
function returns <code>#F</code> if the program cannot be run using
the features provided.
</p>

<p>
This is not a complete implementation of the configuration language; it needs
an (implementation-dependent) method for evaluating the forms returned by
<code>PROCESS-PROGRAM</code>.
</p>

<pre>
(define (process-program program features)
  (call-with-current-continuation
    (lambda (exit)	; We exit early when an unsatisfiable clause is found.

      ; Process each clause in turn

      (define (process-clauses clauses)
	(if (null? clauses)
	    '()
	    (append (process-clause (car clauses))
		    (process-clauses (cdr clauses)))))
      
      ; Dispatch on the type of the clause.

      (define (process-clause clause)
	(case (car clause)
	  ((requires)
	   (if (all-satisfied? (cdr clause))
	       '()
	       (exit #f)))
	  ((code)
	   (cdr clause))
	  ((files)
	   (read-files (cdr clause)))
	  ((feature-cond)
	   (process-cond-clauses (cdr clause)))))
      
      ; Loop through CLAUSES finding the first that is satisfied.

      (define (process-cond-clauses clauses)
	(cond ((null? clauses)
	       (exit #f))
	      ((or (and (eq? (caar clauses) 'else)
			(null? (cdr clauses)))
		   (satisfied? (caar clauses)))
	       (process-clauses (cdar clauses)))
	      (else
	       (process-cond-clauses (cdr clauses)))))
    
      ; Compound requirements are handled recursively, simple ones are tested.

      (define (satisfied? requirement)
	(if (pair? requirement)
	    (case (car requirement)
	      ((and)
	       (all-satisfied? (cdr requirement)))
	      ((or)
	       (any-satisfied? (cdr requirement)))
	      ((not)
	       (not (satisfied? (cadr requirement)))))
	    (memq requirement features)))
      
      ; True if every requirement in LIST is satisfied.

      (define (all-satisfied? list)
	(if (null? list)
	    #t
	    (and (satisfied? (car list))
		 (all-satisfied? (cdr list)))))
      
      ; True if any requirement in LIST is satisfied.

      (define (any-satisfied? list)
	(if (null? list)
	    #f
	    (or (satisfied? (car list))
		(any-satisfied? (cdr list)))))
      
      ; Start by doing the whole program.

      (process-clauses (cdr program)))))

; Returns a list of the forms in the named files.

(define (read-files filenames)
  (if (null? filenames)
      '()
      (append (call-with-input-file (car filenames)
		(lambda (in)
		  (let label ()
		    (let ((next (read in)))
		      (if (eof-object? next)
			  '()
			  (cons next (label)))))))
	      (read-files (cdr filenames)))))
</pre>

<p>
The second implementation is a <code>PROGRAM</code> macro that implements
the configuration language in terms of the <code>COND-EXPAND</code>
syntax of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-0/">SRFI 0</a>.
Note that this implementation requires that <code>LOAD</code> use the current
evaluation environment.
</p>

<pre>
(define-syntax program
  (syntax-rules (requires files code feature-cond)
    ((program)
     (begin))
    ((program (requires feature-id ...)
              more ...)
     (begin (cond-expand ((and feature-id ...) 'okay))
            (program more ...)))
    ((program (files filename ...)
              more ...)
     (begin (load filename) ...
            (program more ...)))
    ((program (code stuff ...)
              more ...)
     (begin stuff ...
            (program more ...)))
    ((program (feature-cond (requirement stuff ...) ...)
              more ...)
     (begin (cond-expand (requirement (program stuff ...)) ...)
            (program more ...)))))
