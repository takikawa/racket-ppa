  </ul>

  <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This document specifies an interface to retrieving and
  displaying locale sensitive messages. A Scheme program can
  register one or more translations of templated messages, and then
  write Scheme code that can transparently retrieve the appropriate
  message for the locale under which the Scheme system is
  running.</p>

  <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

  <p>As any programmer that has ever had to deal with making his or
  her code readable in more than one locale, the process of
  sufficiently abstracting program messages from their presentation
  to the user is non-trivial without help from the programming
  language. Most modern programming language libraries do provide
  some mechanism for performing this separation.</p>

  <p>A portable API that allows a piece of code to run without
  modification in different countries and under different languages
  is a must for any non-trivial software project. &nbsp;The
  interface should separate the logic of a program from the myriad
  of translations that may be necessary.</p>

  <p>The interface described in this document provides such
  functionality. The underlying implementation is also allowed to
  use whatever datastructures it likes to provide access to the
  translations in the most efficient manner possible. &nbsp;In
  addition, the implementation is provided with standardized
  functions that programs will use for accessing an external,
  unspecified repository of translations.</p>

  <p>This interface <i>does not</i> cover all aspects of
  localization, including support for non-latin characters, number
  and date formatting, etc. Such functionality is the scope of a
  future SRFI that may extend this one.</p>

  <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

  <p>A SRFI-29 conformant implementation must also implement
  SRFI-28, Basic Format Strings. Message templates are strings that
  must be processed by the <code>format</code> function specified
  in that SRFI.</p>

  <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

  <h3>Message Bundles</h3>

  <p>A Message Bundle is a set of message templates and their
  identifying keys. Each bundle contains one or more such key/value
  pairs. The bundle itself is associated with a <i>bundle
  specifier</i> which uniquely identifies the bundle.</p>

  <h3>Bundle Specifiers</h3>

  <p>A Bundle Specifier is a Scheme list that describes, in order
  of importance, the package and locale of a message bundle.
  &nbsp;In most cases, a locale specifier will have between one and
  three elements. The first element is a symbol denoting the
  package for which this bundle applies. The second and third
  elements denote a <i>locale</i>. The second element (first
  element of the locale) if present, is the two letter, ISO 639-1
  language code for the bundle. The third element, if present, is a
  two letter ISO 3166-1 country code. &nbsp;In some cases, a fourth
  element may be present, specifying the encoding used for the
  bundle. &nbsp;All bundle specifier elements are Scheme
  symbols.</p>

  <p>If only one translation is provided, it should be designated
  only by a package name, for example <code>(mathlib)</code>. This
  translation is called the <i>default</i> translation.</p>

  <h3>Bundle Searching</h3>

  <p>When a message template is retrieved from a bundle, the Scheme
  implementation will provide the locale under which the system is
  currently running. When the template is retrieved, the package
  name will be specified. The Scheme system should construct a
  Bundle Specifier from the provided package name and the active
  locale. For example, when retrieving a message template for
  French Canadian, in the <code>mathlib</code> package, the bundle
  specifier '<code>(mathlib fr ca)</code>' is used. A program may
  also retrieve the elements of the current locale using the
  no-argument procedures:</p>

  <p><b><code id="current-language">current-language</code></b>
  <code>-&gt; <i>symbol</i></code><br>
  <code><b>current-language</b> <i>symbol</i> -&gt;
  undefined</code><br></p>

  <blockquote>
    When given no arguments, returns the current ISO 639-1 language
    code as a symbol. &nbsp;If provided with an argument, the
    current language is set to that named by the symbol for the
    currently executing Scheme thread (or for the entire Scheme
    system if such a distinction is not possible). &nbsp;
  </blockquote>

  <p><b><code id="current-country">current-country</code></b>
  <code>-&gt; <i>symbol</i></code><br>
  <code><b>current-country</b> <i>symbol</i> -&gt;
  undefined</code><br></p>

  <blockquote>
    returns the current ISO 3166-1 country code as a symbol.
    &nbsp;If provided with an argument, the current country is set
    to that named by the symbol for the currently executing Scheme
    thread (or for the entire Scheme system if such a distinction
    is not possible). &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </blockquote>

  <p><b><code id=
  "current-locale-details">current-locale-details</code></b>
  <code>-&gt; <i>list of symbol</i></code>s<br>
  <code><b>current-locale-details</b> <i>list-of-symbols</i> -&gt;
  undefined</code><br></p>

  <blockquote>
    Returns a list of additional locale details as a list of
    symbols. &nbsp;This list may contain information about
    encodings or other more specific information. &nbsp;If provided
    with an argument, the current locale details are set to those
    given in the currently executing Scheme thread (or for the
    entire Scheme system if such a distinction is not
    possible).&nbsp;
  </blockquote>

  <p>The Scheme System should first check for a bundle with the
  exact name provided. If no such bundle is found, the last element
  from the list is removed and a search is tried for a bundle with
  that name. If no bundle is then found, the list is shortened by
  removing the last element again. If no message is found and the
  bundle specifier is now the empty list, an error should be
  raised.</p>

  <p>The reason for this search order is to provide the most locale
  sensitive template possible, but to fall back on more general
  templates if a translation has not yet been provided for the
  given locale.</p>

  <h3>Message Templates</h3>

  <p>A message template is a localized message that may or may not
  contain one of a number of formatting codes. A message template
  is a Scheme string. The string is of a form that can be processed
  by the <code>format</code> procedure found in many Scheme systems
  and formally specified in SRFI-28 (Basic Format Strings).</p>

  <p>This SRFI also extends SRFI-28 to provide an additional
  <code>format</code> escape code:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <code>~[n]@*</code> - Causes a value-requiring escape code that
    follows this code immediately to reference the [N]'th optional
    value absolutely, rather than the next unconsumed value. The
    referenced value is <i>not</i> consumed.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This extension allows optional values to be positionally
  referenced, so that message templates can be constructed that can
  produce the proper word ordering for a language.</p>

  <h3>Preparing Bundles</h3>

  <p>Before a bundle may be used by the Scheme system to retrieve
  localized template messages, they must be made available to the
  Scheme system. &nbsp;This SRFI specifies a way to portably define
  the bundles, as well as store them in and retrieve them from an
  unspecified system which may be provided by resources outside the
  Scheme system.</p>

  <p><b><code id="declare-bundle!">declare-bundle!</code></b>
  <code><i>bundle-specifier association-list</i> -&gt;
  undefined<br></code></p>

  <blockquote>
    Declares a new bundle named by the given bundle-specifier.
    &nbsp;The contents of the bundle are defined by the provided
    association list. &nbsp;The list contains associations between
    Scheme symbols and the message templates (Scheme strings) they
    name. &nbsp;If a bundle already exists with the given name, it
    is overwritten with the newly declared bundle.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <code id="store-bundle"><b>store-bundle</b>
  <i>bundle-specifier</i> -&gt; boolean</code><br>

  <blockquote>
    Attempts to store a bundle named by the given bundle specifier,
    and previously made available using
    <code>declare-bundle!</code> or <code>load-bundle!</code>, in
    an unspecified mechanism that may be persistent across Scheme
    system restarts. &nbsp;If successful, a non-false value is
    returned. &nbsp;If unsuccessful, <code>#f</code> is
    returned.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <code id="load-bundle!"><b>load-bundle!</b>
  <i>bundle-specifier</i> -&gt; boolean</code><br>

  <blockquote>
    Attempts to retrieve a bundle from an unspecified mechanism
    which stores bundles outside the Scheme system. &nbsp;If the
    bundle was retrieved successfully, the function returns a
    non-false value, and the bundle is immediately available to the
    Scheme system. If the bundle could not be found or loaded
    successfully, the function returns <code>#f</code>, and the
    Scheme system's bundle registry remains unaffected.<br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>A compliant Scheme system may choose not to provide any
  external mechanism to store localized bundles. &nbsp;If it does
  not, it must still provide implementations for
  <code>store-bundle</code> and <code>load-bundle!</code>. In such
  a case, both functions must return <code>#f</code> regardless of
  the arguments given. Users of this SRFI should recognize that the
  inability to load or store a localized bundle in an external
  repository is <i>not</i> a fatal error.</p>

  <h3>Retrieving Localized Message Templates</h3>

  <p><b><code id="localized-template">localized-template</code></b>
  <i><code>package-name message-template-name</code></i>
  <code>-&gt; <i>string or #f<br></i></code></p>

  <blockquote>
    Retrieves a localized message template for the given package
    name and the given message template name (both symbols).
    &nbsp;If no such message could be found, false (#f) is
    returned.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>

  <p>After retrieving a template, the calling program can use
  <code>format</code> to produce a string that can be displayed to
  the user.</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <p>The below example makes use of SRFI-29 to display simple,
  localized messages. &nbsp;It also defines its bundles in such a
  way that the Scheme system may store and retrieve the bundles
  from a more efficient system catalog, if available.</p>

  <pre>
(let ((translations
       '(((en) . ((time . "Its ~a, ~a.")
                (goodbye . "Goodbye, ~a.")))
         ((fr) . ((time . "~1@*~a, c'est ~a.")
                (goodbye . "Au revoir, ~a."))))))
  (for-each (lambda (translation)
              (let ((bundle-name (cons 'hello-program (car translation))))
                (if (not (load-bundle! bundle-name))
                    (begin
                     (declare-bundle! bundle-name (cdr translation))
                     (store-bundle! bundle-name)))))
             translations))

(define localized-message
  (lambda (message-name . args)
    (apply format (cons (localized-template 'hello-program
                                            message-name)
                        args))))

(let ((myname "Fred"))
  (display (localized-message 'time "12:00" myname))
  (display #\newline)

  (display (localized-message 'goodbye myname))
  (display #\newline))

;; Displays (English):
;; Its 12:00, Fred.
;; Goodbye, Fred.
;;
;; French:
;; Fred, c'est 12:00.
;; Au revoir, Fred.
</pre>
  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

  <p>The implementation requires that the Scheme system provide a
  definition for <code>current-language</code> and
  <code>current-country</code> capable of distinguishing the
  correct locale present during a Scheme session. The definitions
  of those functions in the reference implementation are not
  capable of that distinction. Their implementation is provided
  only so that the following code can run in any R4RS scheme
  system. &nbsp;<br></p>

  <p>In addition, the below implementation of a compliant
  <code>format</code> requires SRFI-6 (Basic String Ports) and
  SRFI-23 (Error reporting)</p>
