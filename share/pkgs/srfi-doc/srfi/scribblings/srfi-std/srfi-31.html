<h2>Abstract</h2>

We propose the implementation of a special form
called <code>rec</code>.  This form is a generalization and
combination of the forms <code>rec</code> and
<code>named-lambda</code> of <a href="#%5BClinger1985%5D">[Clinger1985]</a>. It allows the simple and
non-imperative construction of self-referential expressions.  As an
important special case, it extends the A. Church form
<code>lambda</code> such that it allows the direct definition of
recursive procedures without using further special forms like
<code>let</code> or <code>letrec</code>, without using advanced
constructions like the H. B. Curry combinator and, unlike
<code>define</code>, without introducing variable bindings into the
external environment.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<h3>General</h3> Among the prominent features of the Scheme
programming language as defined in <a href="#%5BKCR1998%5D">[KCR1998]</a>
are the following.

<ol>

 <li>It has simple syntax.</li>
 
 <li>It encourages recursive definitions, e.g. by ensuring memory
     efficient tail recursion.</li>

 <li>It supports non-imperative programming.</li>

</ol>

Nevertheless Scheme does not provide a syntax for recursive
evaluations with the properties of

<ol>

<li>being as simple, intuitive and close to the mathematical standard
notation as possible,</li>

<li>allowing general recursion,</li>

<li>being non-imperative.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h4>Problem 1</h4>
<p>
Let us look at the factorial function. In mathematical notation this
function is expressed as
</p>
<pre> 
  (F : N |--&gt; 1,            if N = 0; 
              N * F(N - 1), otherwise).
</pre>
<p>
This expression is a term and not a definition or proposition.
</p>
<p>
We investigate some approaches to express the factorial function in Scheme.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The simplest way perhaps is as
</p>
<pre>
(define (F N) 
  (if (zero? N) 1 
    (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>
<p>
But this expression is not a term. It binds the factorial function to
the variable <code>F</code>. The expression itself may not occur in a
syntactical context where a name of the factorial is required.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We list several ways to express the factorial as a function term.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<pre>
(let () 
  (define (F N)
    (if (zero? N) 1 
        (* N (F (- N 1)))))
    F)
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<pre>
(lambda (N) 
  (let F ( (N N) ) 
       (if (zero? N) 1 
	 (* N (F (- N 1))))))
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<pre>
(letrec ( (F (lambda (N) 
	       (if (zero? N) 1 
		 (* N (F (- N 1)))))) )	F)
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<pre>
((lambda (F) 
   (F F))
 (lambda (G) 
   (lambda (N) 
     (if (zero? N) 1 
       (* N ((G G) (- N 1)))))))
</pre>
</li>

</ol>
<p>
All these expressions define the factorial anonymously, not binding it
to a variable. However, all these expressions are more verbose than it
seems necessary and they are less intuitive than it seems
desirable.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h4>Solution 1</h4>
<p>
A solution to our problem was already provided in <a href="#%5BClinger1985%5D">[Clinger1985]</a> by the form
<code>named-lambda</code>. An even earlier solution with a slightly
different syntax was implemented in Kent Dybvig's Chez Scheme system.
</p><p>
Using this special form, we can denote the factorial simply by
</p>
<pre>
(named-lambda (F N) 
              (if (zero? N) 1 
                (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>
<p>
This expression is a function term that denotes the factorial in the
appropriate brevity.

</p><p>However, the form <code>named-lambda</code> has been dropped from
later versions of the Scheme Report. Also it is missing in
state-of-the-art implementations such as Chez Scheme (6.0a) and MIT
Scheme (7.7.0). (The latter actually knows a form
<code>named-lambda</code> with different semantics).
</p>

<h4>Problem 2</h4>

The constant stream of ones can be defined via

<pre>(define S (cons 1 (delay S)))</pre>

As in the case of the factorial, we are able to define the recursive
object at the price of spending an externally bound name. Remedying
this with <code>let</code> or <code>letrec</code> leads to similar
objections as above.

<h4>Solution 2</h4>
<p>
This particular case of the self-referential problem was solved by the
<code>rec</code> form in <a href="#%5BClinger1985%5D">[Clinger1985]</a>.
</p><p>
This form allows writing
</p>
<pre>(rec S (cons 1 (delay S)))</pre>
<p>
This expression is non-imperative and does not introduce an external
variable binding.

</p><p>Also this form has been dropped from later versions of the Scheme
Report. Moreover, from our point of view this form alone is not
capable of solving Problem 1. The respective definition would look
like
</p>
<pre>
(rec F 
     (lambda (N) 
       (if (zero? N) 1 
	 (* N (F (- N 1))))))
</pre>
<p>
This again does not seem quite as simple and intuitive as the
mathematical notation.
</p>

<h3>Proposal</h3>

We therefore propose to implement the <code>rec</code> special form in
a generalized way that combines the advantages of the
<code>named-lambda</code> and <code>rec</code> forms.

The factorial function could be written
<pre>
(rec (F N) 
     (if (zero? N) 1 
       (* N (F (- N 1)))))
</pre>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

The following production rules are to be added to those of <a href="#%5BKCR1998%5D">[KCR1998]</a> (we reuse names of non-terminals).

<ol id="rec">

<li><code>&lt;derived expression&gt; --&gt; &lt;rec expression&gt;</code></li>

<li><code>&lt;rec expression&gt; --&gt; (rec &lt;variable&gt;
&lt;expression&gt;)</code></li>

<li><code>&lt;rec expression&gt; --&gt; (rec (&lt;variable&gt;+)
&lt;body&gt;)</code></li>

</ol>

<h3>Semantics</h3>

Scheme versions such as <a href="#%5BKCR1998%5D">[KCR1998]</a> providing
<code>define-syntax</code>, <code>syntax-rules</code>,
<code>letrec</code> and <code>lambda</code> might implement
<code>rec</code> as follows.

<pre>
(define-syntax rec
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((rec (NAME . VARIABLES) . BODY)
     (letrec ( (NAME (lambda VARIABLES . BODY)) ) NAME))
    ((rec NAME EXPRESSION)
     (letrec ( (NAME EXPRESSION) ) NAME))))
</pre>

<h3>Test</h3>

The following session shows in which way <code>rec</code> allows a
tail-recursive implementation of the factorial function.

<pre>
&gt; (define F (rec (F N)
		((rec (G K L)
		   (if (zero? K) L
		     (G (- K 1) (* K L)))) N 1)))
&gt; F
#&lt;procedure&gt;
&gt; (F 0)
1
&gt; (F 10)

</pre>
