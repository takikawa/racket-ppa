The only information that used to be in this document which isn't
already in "../index.html" (i.e. the Scribble-generated documentation)
is about modules which export prefixed names. That used to be
important, before `require` was allowed to shadow bindings from a
module's language. Is it worth incorporating this information into
"../index.html"?

Much of this is also present in the similarly-outdated
"srfi-lib/srfi/doc.txt". Should we do something about that, too?

Certain SRFIs (currently SRFIs 1, 5, 13, 17, 19, 43, 45, 48, 61, 63, 69 and 87) provide names which conflict with names provided by the racket language. Attempting to require one of these SRFIs in a module written in the racket language will result in an error.

To address this problem, the Racket implementations of these SRFIs provide a different module which renames the problematic exports to avoid these conflicts. For SRFI 1, this library is called list, and should be required like this:

     (require srfi/1/list)

which supplies the colliding names with a prefix of 's:' (e.g. "s:map", "s:reverse!") and is therefore suitable for requires in a module.

For SRFI 19, this library is called time, and should be required like this:

     (require srfi/19/time)

which supplies the colliding names with a prefix of 'srfi:' (e.g. "srfi:date?", "srfi:date-second") and is therefore
suitable for requires in a module.

Notes:

+ Supported by the Racket core

*1 The functionality is all part of racket available via (require ffi/unsafe), the only missing part is the i/o syntax.

*2 The time module does not export its time structure (you have to use the time-* procedures.) It renames all the date-* accessors to tm:date-* so that you won't get errors when including this code in other modules. Care most be taken NOT to confuse the internal date structure with the Racket one, they are not the same, and all procedures from this library expect the former.

*3 This port also provides promise? / srfi-45-promise?.
