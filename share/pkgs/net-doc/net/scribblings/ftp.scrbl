@defmodule[net/ftp]{The @racketmodname[net/ftp] library provides
utilities for FTP client operations.}


@section[#:tag "ftp-procs"]{Functions}

@defproc[(ftp-connection? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] represents an FTP connection as
returned by @racket[ftp-establish-connection], @racket[#f] otherwise.}


@defproc[(ftp-establish-connection [server string?]
                                   [port-no (integer-in 0 65535)]
                                   [user string?]
                                   [passwd string?])
          ftp-connection?]{

Establishes an FTP connection with the given server using the supplied
username and password. The @racket[port-np] argument usually should be
@racket[21].}


@defproc[(ftp-close-connection [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]) void?]{

Closes an FTP connection.}


@defproc[(ftp-cd [ftp-conn ftp-connection?] [new-dir string?]) void?]{

Changes the current directory on the FTP server to @racket[new-dir].
The @racket[new-dir] argument is not interpreted at all, but simply
passed on to the server; it must not contain a newline.}

@defproc[(ftp-directory-list [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                             [path (or/c false/c string?) #f])
         (listof (list/c (one-of/c "-" "d" "l")
                         string?
                         string?))]{

Returns a list of files and directories in the current directory of the
server, assuming that the server provides directory information in the
quasi-standard Unix format.  If a @racket[path] argument is given, use
it instead of the current directory.

Each file or directory is represented by a list of three or four
strings.  The first string is either @racket["-"], @racket["d"], or
@racket["l"], depending on whether the items is a file, directory, or
link, respectively.  The second item is the file's date; to convert this
value to seconds consistent with @racket[file-seconds], pass the date
string to @racket[ftp-make-file-seconds].  The third string is the name
of the file or directory.  If the item is a file (the first string is
@racket["-"]), and if the line that the server replied with has a size
in the expected place, then a fourth string containing this size is
included.

Warning: the FTP protocol has no specification for the reply format, so
this information can be unreliable.}


@defproc[(ftp-make-file-seconds [ftp-date string?]) exact-integer?]{

Takes a date string produced by @racket[ftp-directory-list] and
converts it to seconds (which can be used with
@racket[seconds->date]).

Warning: the FTP protocol has no specification for the reply format, so
this information can be unreliable.}


@defproc[(ftp-download-file [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                            [local-dir-or-port (or/c path-string?
			    		       	     output-port?)]
                            [file string?]
                            [#:progress progress-proc
                                        (or/c #f 
                                              (-> (-> (values exact-nonnegative-integer? 
                                                              evt?)) 
                                                  any)) 
                                        #f]) 
         void?]{

If @racket[local-dir-or-port] is a @racket[path-string?],
@racket[ftp-download-file] downloads @racket[file] from the server's current
directory and puts it in @racket[local-dir-or-port] using the same name. If the
file already exists in the local directory, it is replaced, but only after the
transfer succeeds (i.e., the file is first downloaded to a temporary file in
@racket[local-dir-or-port], then moved into place on success).

When @racket[local-dir-or-port] is an @racket[output-port?], it downloads
@racket[file] from the server's current directory and writes its content to
provided @racket[output-port?]. The data is written to the port as it is being
received from the server and if the download is interrupted, incomplete data is
written to the port. The port is closed after finishing the transfer.

If @racket[progress-proc] is not @racket[#f], then it is called with a
function @racket[_get-count] that returns two values: the number of bytes
transferred so far, and an event that becomes ready when the
transferred-bye count changes. The @racket[_get-count] function can be
called in any thread and any number of times. The @racket[progress-proc] function should
return immediately, perhaps starting a thread that periodically polls
@racket[_get-count]. Do not poll too frequently, or else polling
will slow the transfer; the second argument from @racket[_get-count]
is intended to limit polling.

        (loop))))))

                                      #f])
         void?]{

When @racket[port] is @racket[#f], upload @racket[file-path] to the server's
current directory using the same name.  If the file already exists in the remote
directory, it is replaced.  The @racket[progress-proc] argument is used in the
same way as in @racket[ftp-download-file], but to report uploaded bytes instead
of downloaded bytes.

If @racket[port] is an @racket[input-port?], the content of that port is
streamed as upload to the server and stored under given @racket[file-path]
name. The port is closed after finishing the transfer.}

@defproc[(ftp-delete-file [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                          [file-path path-string?]) void?]{
Delete the remote file use the @racket[file-path] on the server.}

@defproc[(ftp-make-directory [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                             [dir-name string?]) void?]{
Make remote directory use the @racket[dir-name].}

@defproc[(ftp-delete-directory [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                               [dir-name string?]) void?]{
Delete remote directory use the @racket[dir-name].}

@defproc[(ftp-rename-file [ftp-conn ftp-connection?]
                          [origin string?]
                          [dest string?]) void?]{
Rename remote file name from @racket[origin] to @racket[dest].}

@section{FTP Unit}

@margin-note{@racket[ftp@] and @racket[ftp^] are deprecated.
They exist for backward-compatibility and will likely be removed in
the future. New code should use the @racketmodname[net/ftp] module.}

@defmodule[net/ftp-unit]

@defthing[ftp@ unit?]{

Imports nothing, exports @racket[ftp^].}

@; ----------------------------------------

@section{FTP Signature}

@defmodule[net/ftp-sig]

@defsignature[ftp^ ()]{}

Includes everything exported by the @racketmodname[net/ftp] module.
