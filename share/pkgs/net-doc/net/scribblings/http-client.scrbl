an argument to @racket[ssl-connect] to, for example, check

         void?]{

Sends an HTTP request to @racket[hc] to the URI @racket[uri] using
HTTP version @racket[version], the method @racket[method], and the
additional headers given in @racket[headers] and the additional data
@racket[data]. If @racket[method] is @racket[#"HEAD"] (or
@racket["HEAD"] or @racket['HEAD]), provide the same @racket[method]
when calling @racket[http-conn-recv!] to avoid attempting to receive content.

If @racket[data] is a procedure, it will be called once with a
procedure of one argument, which is a string or
byte string to be written to the request body using
chunked transfer encoding.

If @racket[headers] does not contain an @litchar{Accept-Encoding}
header, then a header indicating that encodings from @racket[decodes]
are accepted is automatically added.

If @racket[close?] is @racket[#t] and @racket[headers] does not
contain a @litchar{Connection} header, then a @litchar{Connection:
close} header will be added.

This function does not support requests that expect
@litchar{100 (Continue)} responses.

                          [#:close? close? boolean? #f])
         (values bytes? (listof bytes?) input-port?)]{

Parses an HTTP response from @racket[hc] for the method
@racket[method] while decoding the encodings listed in
@racket[decodes].

Returns the status line, a list of headers, and an port which contains
the contents of the response. The port's content must be consumed
before the connection is used further.

If @racket[close?] is @racket[#t], then the connection will be closed
following the response parsing. If @racket[close?] is @racket[#f],
then the connection is only closed if the server instructs the client
to do so.

Calls @racket[http-conn-send!] and @racket[http-conn-recv!] in
sequence on a fresh HTTP connection produced by
@racket[http-conn-open].

The HTTP connection is not returned, so it is always closed after one
response, which is why there is no @racket[#:closed?] argument like
@racket[http-conn-recv!].

@section[#:tag "faq"]{Troubleshooting and Tips}

@subsection{How do I send properly formatted POST form requests?}

You should send a @litchar{Content-Type} header with the value
@litchar{application/x-www-form-urlencoded} and send the data
formatted by @racketmodname[net/uri-codec]'s
@racket[form-urlencoded-encode] function. For example,

@(require (for-label net/uri-codec))
@racketblock[
(http-conn-send!
   hc "/login"
   #:method "POST"
   #:data
   (alist->form-urlencoded
    (list (cons 'username "Ryu")
          (cons 'password "Sheng Long")))
   #:headers (list "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"))             
]
