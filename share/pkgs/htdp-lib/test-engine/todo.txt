BIGGEST FAILURE: 
   There is no single point of control for anything here. 




TestEngine : 
  -- split up to test at various language levels
  -- run automated tests (at the moment the test suite isn't really tested)

;; *****************************************************************************
To add a check-* feature to the HtDP languages, you need to: 

1. htdp-lib/test-engine
   create the basic functionality in racket-tests.rkt 
   add a structure to test-info.scm for reporting test failures 
   modify test-display.scm test-engine.rkt so that they display failures in
   gui and repl, respectively 

2. htdp-test/test-engine:
   add tests to TestEngineTest.rkt

3. htdp-lib/lang:
   propagate the new name in 
   htdp-beginner.rkt htdp-beginner-abbr.rkt htdp-intermediate.rkt htdp-intermediate-lambda.rkt htdp-advanced.rkt
   
   raco setup htdp; drracket test-file-for-new-syntax-in-bsl-and-isl+ [see 2]

4. htdp-doc/test-engine
   htdp-doc/lang/scribblings 

   edit the following, follow the check-random example: 
    beginner.scrbl 
    beginner-abbr.scrbl 
    intermediate.scrbl
    intermediate-lambda.scrbl 
    advanced.scrbl 
    prim-ops.rkt 
    std-grammar.rkt

   raco setup scribblings
