When modifying the string constants files,
please adhere to these guidelines:

- All the entries in english-string-constants.rkt have the same format
  (name string).  If the purpose of an entry you are adding to the
  file is not clear from just the name and string, put a comment next
  to the entry explaining what the string is going to be used for and
  in what context.
  That's especially true for strings that contain things like "~a".
  Systematically describe what the "~a" is going to be replaced with.
  When we have to translate strings like "deleting ~a", we translators
  need to know what "~a" is going to be (in particular, in some
  languages like French, we need to know whether the "~a" is going to
  be a masculine or feminine word, or whether it's going to be
  singular or plural, etc).

- When adding a bunch of new entries, put together in a section the
  entries that logically belong together.  Give a title to your
  section, so we have an idea of what the strings are for.  Don't mix
  in the same section strings that have nothing to do with each other,
  that's only going to confuse us.  Do not start a new section if
  there's already one that deals with the same thing.  Dumping all the
  new entries in random order at the end of the file is not a good way
  to have your new entries translated in a timely manner...

- Before adding strings for your new pet tool, check whether you can't
  re-use strings that already exist.  There's no need for yet another
  "Ok" string...

- If you modify an existing string in english-string-constants.rkt, go
  through all the *-string-constants.rkt files for the other languages,
  comment out the old version of the modified string in each of these
  files, and put a short comment there telling us the English string
  has changed and needs to be re-translated.  Do not erase the old
  version, it might help us translate the new one.  Do not move it
  either.  Just comment it out and add the short comment.  After the
  next git update DrRacket will automatically tell us translators that
  a new string needs to be translated, we will find your comment in
  the file, and know what to do.
	Some evil evil people might think that, since DrRacket automatically
  informs us of new strings to be translated, an easier thing to do
  when modifying an existing string would be to simply rename it at
  the same time.  This works, except that if you do that, we
  translators will get two warnings from DrRacket:
		language english had but french does not:
		(new-name "New String")
		language french had but english does not:
		(old-name "Old String")
  then we translators will be left to wonder whether the two things
  are related or not, and whether we can safely base our translation
  of "New String" on the translation of "Old String" (since the two
  strings are likely to be close in meaning).  Worse, we might not
  even realize the two strings are related and translate "New String"
  from scratch, just to realize later that it's only a variation of
  "Old String".  I can tell you that nothing pisses off a translator
  more than having to translate pretty much the same string twice
  just because *you* were too lazy to inform us that it was just a
  slight modification to an existing string rather than an entirely
  new one.  Conclusion: do not change the name of a string unless you
  have some really good reason to do so.

- Please think hard before choosing a string and make sure it means
  what you want it to mean.  That way you won't have to change it
  later, and we won't have to retranslate it.

- Please think hard before choosing the name for a string.  Use
  meaningful names.  "error" or "ok" are not meaningful names.  Prefix
  all related names with a common prefix (the name of your tool or
  module).  String names are not the right place to save on typing.

- If, for some reason, you really have to change the name of a string
  (like, because the original name you gave it really sucked...),
  change the name of the string in *ALL* the *-string-constants.rkt
  files.  That's a modification you can do without the help of a
  translator, so do it yourself.  It's not the job of the translators
  to clean up your naming mess for you.  Besides, you are the one who
  knows what you changed, so leaving the translators having to guess
  what you did is Not Nice(tm).

- If, for some reason, you need to remove a string (i.e. you changed
  your code and don't need the string anymore), remove the string in
  *ALL* the *-string-constants.rkt files.  Again, you don't need the
  help of a translator to do that.  If you're not sure whether you
  might need the string in the future or not, just comment it out in
  *ALL* the files.
