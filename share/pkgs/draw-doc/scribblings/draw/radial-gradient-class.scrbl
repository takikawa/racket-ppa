@defclass/title[radial-gradient% object% ()]{

A @deftech{radial gradient} is used with a @racket[brush%] to fill
 areas with smooth color transitions.
 Color transitions are based on two circles and the sequence of
 circles that ``morph'' from the starting circle to the ending
 circle. Normally, one of the two circles defining a gradient is
 nested within the other; in that case, points within the inner circle
 get the same color as the inner circle's edge, while points outside
 the outer circle get the same color as the outer circle's edge.

@defconstructor[([x0 real?]
                 [y0 real?]
                 [r0 real?]
                 [x1 real?]
                 [y1 real?]
                 [r1 real?]
                 [stops (listof (list/c (real-in 0 1) (is-a?/c color%)))])]{

Creates a radial gradient with the starting circle as the one with
radius @racket[r0] centered at (@racket[x0], @racket[y0]) and the
ending circle as the one with radius @racket[r1] centered at
(@racket[x1], @racket[y1]). The @racket[stops] list assigns colors to
circles, where @racket[0.0] corresponds to the starting circle,
@racket[1.0] corresponds to the ending circle, and numbers in between
correspond to circles in between.

The order of elements within @racket[stops] and duplicate points are
treated in the same way for as @racket[linear-gradient%].
