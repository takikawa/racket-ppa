This library defines @deftech{orders} and the @deftech{ordered
dictionary} generic interface.

@defthing[ordering/c flat-contract?]{

Contract for orderings, represented by the symbols @racket['=],
@racket['<], and @racket['>].
}

@defthing[gen:ordered-dict any/c]{

A generic interface for defining new ordered dictionary types.
Methods can be attached to the @racket[gen:ordered-dict] interface
using the @racket[#:methods] keyword in a structure type definition.
Two ``extrema'' methods and four ``search'' methods should be
implemented. The extrema methods must satisfy @racket[_e/c] and the search
methods must satisfy @racket[_s/c]:

@racketblock[
_e/c = (->i ([d ordered-dict?])
            [_ (d) (or/c #f (dict-iter-contract d))])
_s/c = (->i ([d ordered-dict?]
             [k (d) (dict-key-contract d)])
            [_ (d) (or/c #f (dict-iter-contract d))])
]

The methods are implementations of the following generic functions:

@itemize[
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-least]}
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-greatest]}
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-least/>?]}
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-least/>=?]}
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-greatest/<?]}
@item{@racket[dict-iterate-greatest/<=?]}
]

A struct type that implements @racket[gen:ordered-dict] must also
implement @racket[gen:dict].
}

@defthing[prop:ordered-dict
          (struct-type-property/c
           (vectorof _e/c _e/c _s/c _s/c _s/c _s/c))]{
  A deprecated structure type property used to defined custom
  ordered dictionaries. Use @racket[gen:ordered-dict] instead.
  Accepts a vector of 6 procedures with the same arguments as
  the methods of @racket[gen:ordered-dict].
}

@defproc[(ordered-dict? [x any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[x] is an instance of a struct
implementing the @tech{ordered dictionary} interface (via
@racket[gen:ordered-dict]).
}

@deftogether[[
@defproc[(dict-iterate-least [dict ordered-dict?])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]
@defproc[(dict-iterate-greatest [dict ordered-dict?])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]]]{

Returns the position of the least (greatest) key in the ordered
dictionary @racket[dict]. If @racket[dict] is empty, @racket[#f] is
returned.
}

@deftogether[[
@defproc[(dict-iterate-least/>? [dict ordered-dict?] [key any/c])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]
@defproc[(dict-iterate-least/>=? [dict ordered-dict?] [key any/c])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]
@defproc[(dict-iterate-greatest/<? [dict ordered-dict?] [key any/c])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]
@defproc[(dict-iterate-greatest/<=? [dict ordered-dict?] [key any/c])
         (or/c (dict-iter-contract dict) #f)]
]]{

Returns the position of the least key greater than @racket[key], the
least key greater than or equal to @racket[key], the greatest key less
than @racket[key], and the greatest key less than or equal to
@racket[key], respectively. If no key satisfies the criterion,
@racket[#f] is returned.
}

@defproc*[([(order [name symbol?] 
                   [domain-contract contract?]
                   [comparator (-> any/c any/c ordering/c)])
            (and/c order? procedure?)]
           [(order [name symbol?]
                   [domain-contract contract?]
                   [=? (-> any/c any/c boolean?)]
                   [<? (-> any/c any/c boolean?)]
                   [>? (-> any/c any/c boolean?)
                       (lambda (x y) (<? y x))])
            (and/c order? procedure?)])]{

Produces a named order object encapsulating a domain contract and a
comparator function. If a single procedure is given, it is used
directly as the comparator. If two or three procedures are given, they
are used to construct the comparator.

The @racket[domain-contract] is not applied to the comparison
function; rather, clients of the order are advised to incorporate the
domain contracts into their own contracts. For example, when a
splay-tree (see @racketmodname[data/splay-tree]) is constructed with
an order, it applies the domain-contract to its keys. Thus the
contract is checked once per dictionary procedure call, rather than on
every comparison.

An order object is applicable as a procedure; it behaves as its
comparator.

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(define string-order (order 'string-order string? string=? string<?))
(string-order "abc" "acdc")
(string-order "x" 12)
]
}

@defproc[(order? [x any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[x] is an order object, @racket[#f]
otherwise.
}

@defproc[(order-comparator [ord order?])
         (-> any/c any/c ordering/c)]{

Extracts the comparator function from an order object.
}

@defproc[(order-domain-contract [ord order?]) contract?]{

Extracts the domain contract from an order object.
}

@deftogether[[
@defproc[(order-=? [ord order?]) (-> any/c any/c boolean?)]
@defproc[(order-<? [ord order?]) (-> any/c any/c boolean?)]
]]{

Returns a procedure representing the order's equality relation or
less-than relation, respectively.
}

@defthing[real-order order?]{

The order of the real numbers. The domain of @racket[real-order]
excludes @racket[+nan.0] but includes @racket[+inf.0] and
@racket[-inf.0]. The standard numeric comparisons (@racket[=],
@racket[<]) are used; exact @racket[1] is equal to inexact
@racket[1.0].

@examples[#:eval the-eval
(real-order 1.0 1)
(real-order 5 7)
(real-order 9.0 3.4)
(real-order 1 +inf.0)
(real-order 5 -inf.0)
]
}

@defthing[datum-order order?]{

An ad hoc order that encompasses many built-in Racket data types as
well as prefab structs and fully-transparent structs. The
@racket[datum-order] comparator orders values of the same data type
according to the data type's natural order: @racket[string=?],
@racket[string<?] for strings, for example (but see the warning about
numbers below). Different data types are ordered arbitrarily but
contiguously; for example, all strings sort before all vectors, or
vice versa. Prefab and fully-transparent structs are ordered according
to their most specific struct type, and prefab structs are ordered
first by their prefab struct keys. The ordering of struct types is
independent of the struct type hierarchy; a struct type may sort
before one of its subtypes but after another.

Programs should not rely on the ordering of different data types,
since it may change in future versions of Racket to improve comparison
performance. The ordering of non-prefab struct types may change
between one execution of a program and the next.

The order is guaranteed, however, to lexicographically sort proper
lists, vectors, prefab structs, and fully-transparent
structs. Improper lists sort lexicographically considered as pairs,
but the ordering of an improper list and its proper prefix, such as
@racket['(a b . c)] and @racket['(a b)], is not specified.

The @racket[datum-order] comparator does not perform cycle-detection;
comparisons involving cyclic data may diverge.

@bold{Warning:} @racket[datum-order] is not compatible with the
standard numeric order; all exact numbers are ordered separately from
all inexact numbers. Thus @racket[1] is considered distinct from
@racket[1.0], for example.

The following data types are currently supported: numbers, strings,
bytes, keywords, symbols, booleans, characters, null, pairs, vectors,
boxes, prefab structs, and fully-transparent structs.

The following example comparisons are specified to return the results
shown:
@interaction[#:eval the-eval
(datum-order 1 2)
(datum-order 8.0 5.0)
(datum-order 'apple 'candy)
(datum-order '(a #:b c) '(a #:c d c))
(datum-order '(5 . 4) '(3 2 1))
(datum-order '(a b . c) '(a b . z))
(datum-order "apricot" "apple")
(datum-order '#(1 2 3) '#(1 2))
(datum-order '#(1 2 3) '#(1 3))
(datum-order (box 'car) (box 'candy))
(datum-order '#s(point a 1) '#s(point b 0))
(datum-order '#s(A 1 2) '#s(Z 3 4 5))
(struct fish (name) #:transparent)
(datum-order (fish 'alewife) (fish 'sockeye))
]

The following example comparisons are unspecified but consistent within
all executions of a single version of Racket:
@racketblock[
(datum-order 1 2.0)
(datum-order 3+5i 3+2i)
(datum-order 'apple "zucchini")
(datum-order '(a b) '(a b . c))
(datum-order 0 'zero)
]

The following example comparison is unspecified but consistent within
a single execution of a program:
@racketblock[
(struct fowl (name) #:transparent)
(datum-order (fish 'alewife) (fowl 'dodo))
]
}
