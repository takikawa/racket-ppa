@defmodule[web-server/servlet-dispatch]{

These functions optimize the construction of dispatchers and launching of servers for single servlets and interactive development.

@defproc[(dispatch/servlet 
          [start (request? . -> . response?)]
          [#:regexp regexp regexp? #rx""]

         dispatcher/c]{
 @racket[serve/servlet] starts a server and uses a particular dispatching sequence. For some applications, this
 nails down too much, but users are conflicted, because the interface is so convenient. For those users, @racket[dispatch/servlet]
 does the hardest part of @racket[serve/servlet] and constructs a dispatcher just for the @racket[start] servlet.
 
 The dispatcher responds to requests that match @racket[regexp]. The current directory
 of servlet execution is @racket[servlet-current-directory]. 
 
 If @racket[stateless?] is true, then the servlet is run as a stateless @racketmod[web-server] module and @racket[stuffer] is used
 as the @tech[#:doc '(lib "web-server/scribblings/web-server.scrbl")]{stuffer}.

 The servlet is loaded with @racket[manager] as its continuation manager. (The default manager limits the amount of memory to 64 MB and
 deals with memory pressure as discussed in the @racket[make-threshold-LRU-manager] documentation.)
 
 The servlet is run in the @racket[(current-namespace)].

 If a servlet fails to load, @racket[responders-servlet-loading] is used. If a servlet errors during its operation, @racket[responders-servlet] is used.

         void]{
 The other interesting part of @racket[serve/servlet] is its ability to start up a server and immediately
 launch a browser at it. This is provided by @racket[serve/launch/wait].
 
 It starts a server using the result of @racket[make-dispatcher] as the dispatcher. @racket[make-dispatcher] is supplied
 a semaphore that if posted, will cause the server to quit.
 
 If @racket[launch-path] is not false, then a browser is launched with that path appended to the URL to the server itself.
 
 If @racket[banner?] is true, then a banner is printed informing the user of the server's URL.
 
 The server listens on @racket[listen-ip] and port @racket[port]. If @racket[listen-ip] is @racket[#f], then the server accepts 
 connections to all of the listening machine's addresses. Otherwise, the server accepts connections only at the interface(s) associated with the given string.
 For example, providing @racket["127.0.0.1"] (the default) as @racket[listen-ip] creates a server that accepts only connections to @racket["127.0.0.1"] (the loopback interface) from the local machine.

@racket[max-waiting] is passed to @racket[serve] to control the TCP backlog.
 
 If @racket[ssl-key] and @racket[ssl-cert] are not false, then the server runs in HTTPS mode with @racket[ssl-cert]
 and @racket[ssl-key] as paths to the certificate and private key.    
 
 If @racket[connection-close?] is @racket[#t], then every connection is closed after one
 request. Otherwise, the client decides based on what HTTP version it uses.
