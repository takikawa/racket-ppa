@title{Shadows}

@defmodule[pict/shadow]

These pict transformations add shadows or blurring in various shapes and
forms.

@defproc[(blur [p pict?]
               [h-radius (and/c real? (not/c negative?))]
               [v-radius (and/c real? (not/c negative?)) h-radius])
         pict?]{

Blurs @racket[p] using an iterated box blur that approximates a
gaussian blur. The @racket[h-radius] and @racket[v-radius] arguments
control the strength of the horizontal and vertical components of the
blur, respectively. They are given in terms of pict units, which may
not directly correspond to screen pixels.

The @racket[blur] function takes work proportional to
@racketblock[(* (pict-width p) (pict-height p))]
but it may be sped up by a factor of up to @racket[(processor-count)]
due to the use of @racket[future]s.

@examples[#:eval the-eval

(blur (text "more blur" null 40) 10)
(blur (text "much blur" null 40) 20)
(blur (text "horiz. blur" null 40) 10 0)
]
The resulting pict has the same bounding box as @racket[p], so when
picts are automatically @racket[clip]ped (as in Scribble documents),
the pict should be @racket[inset] by the blur radius.

         pict?]{

Creates a shadow effect by superimposing @racket[p] over a
blurred version of @racket[p]. The shadow is offset from @racket[p] by
(@racket[dx], @racket[dy]) units.

If @racket[color] is not @racket[#f], the foreground part is
@racket[(colorize p color)]; otherwise it is just @racket[p]. If
@racket[shadow-color] is not @racket[#f], the shadow part is produced
by blurring @racket[(colorize p shadow-color)]; otherwise it is
produced by blurring @racket[p].

The resulting pict has the same bounding box as @racket[p].

         pict?]{

Surrounds the @racket[pict]s with a rectangular frame that casts a
symmetric ``curled paper'' shadow.

The @racket[pict]s are vertically appended with @racket[separation]
space between them. They are placed on a rectangular background of
solid @racket[bg-color] with @racket[margin] space on all sides. A
frame of @racket[frame-color] and @racket[frame-line-width] is added
around the rectangle, unless @racket[frame-line-width] is
@racket['no-frame]. The rectangle casts a shadow that extends
@racket[shadow-side-length] to the left and right, starts
@racket[shadow-top-y-offset] below the top of the rectangle and
extends to @racket[shadow-bottom-y-offset] below the bottom of the
rectangle in the center and an additional @racket[shadow-descent]
below that on the sides. The shadow is painted using a linear
gradient; @racket[shadow-alpha-factor] determines its density at the
center. Finally, the shadow is blurred by @racket[blur-radius]; all
previous measurements are pre-blur measurements.
