@title[#:tag "prefs-explanation"]{Preferences}

The preferences dialog consists of several panels.


@section{@onscreen{Font}}

This panel controls the main font used by DrRacket.


@section{@onscreen{Colors}}

The @onscreen{Colors} panel has several sub-panels that let you
configure the colors that DrRacket uses for the editor background, for
highlighting matching parentheses, for the syntax coloring for Racket
and Java modes, for @onscreen{Check Syntax}, and for the colors of the
text in the @tech{interactions window}.

It also has two buttons, @onscreen{White on Black} and @onscreen{Black
on White}, which set a number of defaults for the color preferences and
change a few other aspects of DrRacket's behavior to make DrRacket's
colors look nicer for those two modes.


@section{@onscreen{Editing}}

The @onscreen{Editing} panel consists of several sub-panels:

@itemize[

@item{@onscreen{Indenting}

      This panel controls which keywords DrRacket recognizes for
      indenting, and how each keyword is treated.}

@item{@onscreen{Square bracket}

      This panel controls which keywords DrRacket uses to determine when
      to rewrite @litchar["["] to @litchar["("].  For @racket[cond]-like
      keywords, the number in parenthesis indicates how many
      sub-expressions are skipped before square brackets are started.

      See @secref["editor"] for details on how the entries in the
      columns behave.}

@item{@onscreen{General}

      @itemize[
      @item{@PrefItem{Map delete to backspace} --- If checked, the editor
            treats the Delete key like the Backspace key.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Wrap words in editor buffers} --- If checked,
            DrRacket editors auto-wrap text lines by default.  Changing
            this preference affects new windows only.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Enable keybindings in menus} --- If checked, some
            DrRacket menu items have keybindings.  Otherwise, no menu
            items have key bindings.  This preference is designed for
            people who are comfortable editing in Emacs and find the
            standard menu keybindings interfere with the Emacs
            keybindings.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Treat command key as meta} --- If checked,
            DrRacket will use the command key for some Emacs-like
            keybindings, instead of using it for menu shortcuts. This
            option is only available on Mac OS X.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Color syntax interactively} --- If checked,
            DrRacket colors your syntax as you type.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Search using anchors} --- If checked, DrRacket's
            searching mode will jump directly to the first search hit,
            using an ``anchor'' to determine where to search if the
            search string changes.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Normalize pasted strings} --- If checked, DrRacket
            adjusts strings that are pasted into the editor to avoid
            confusion.  For example, non-breaking spaces look just like
            spaces but are not considered separators like ordinary
            spaces are.  If this is checked DrRacket will automatically
            turn those non-breaking spaces into regular spaces.
            Similarly with other (less common) characters.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Enable overwrite mode keybindings} --- If checked,
            DrRacket enables the insert keybinding to swap into
            overwrite mode}
      @item{@PrefItem{Enable automatic parentheses} --- If checked,
             typing an open parenthesis, curley brace, square bracket, or a double quote
             character automatically inserts a matching one.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Add one pixel of extra space between lines} ---
             If checked, then an extra pixel of whitespace is added
             between lines in the editor. The default value is platform-specific;
             some fonts (notably those with @tt{╔══╗} characters) only look right with
             this unchecked.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Always use the platform-specific linefeed convention} ---
             If checked, DrRacket always saves files with CRLF line terminators. 
             If unchecked, DrRacket looks at each file as it is opened and if every
             line is terminated with CRLF (and there is at least one line), 
             then it saves the file with CRLF terminators
             and otherwise it is saved with LF terminators (following the
             Mac OS X and Linux convention). When a file is going to be saved
             with CRLF terminators, then the status line at the bottom of the
             DrRacket window shows ``CRLF''.
             
             This option is only available under Windows. On other operating
             systems, all files are always saved with LF line terminators.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Maximum character width guide} --- If checked, DrRacket
             draws a vertical line in files that exceed the given maximum
             width. The vertical line shows where the given maximum width is.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Show line numbers} --- If checked, DrRacket shows
            line numbers for the file being edited in the left-hand
            column}
      @item{@PrefItem{Show definitions/interactions labels} --- If checked,
             then the teaching languages show big friendly labels indicating
             which window is the definitions window and which is the interactions
             window.]}]}

@item{@onscreen{Racket}

      @itemize[
      @item{@PrefItem{Highlight between matching parens} --- If checked,
            the editor marks the region between matching parenthesis
            with a gray background (in color) or a stipple pattern (in
            monochrome) when the blinking caret is next to a
            parenthesis.}
      @item{@PrefItem{Automatically adjust closing parens} --- If
            checked, the editor automatically converts a typed
            @litchar[")"] to @litchar["]"] to match @litchar["["], or it
            converts a typed @litchar["]"] to @litchar[")"] to match
            @litchar["("].}
      @item{@PrefItem{Automatically adjust opening square brackets} If
            checked, the editor changes typed @litchar["["] to match the
            context (as explained in @secref["editor"]).}
      @item{@PrefItem{Flash paren match} --- If checked, typing a
            closing parenthesis, square bracket, or quotation mark
            flashes the matching open parenthesis/bracket/quote.}]}

]


@section{@onscreen{Warnings}}

@itemize[

@item{@PrefItem{Ask before changing save format} --- If checked,
      DrRacket consults the user before saving a file in non-text format
      (see @secref["drracket-file-formats"]).}

@item{@PrefItem{Verify exit} --- If checked, DrRacket consults the
      user before exiting.}

@item{@PrefItem{Ask about normalizing strings} --- If checked, DrRacket
      consults the user before normalizing a string pasted into the
      editor.}

@item{@PrefItem{Only warn once when executions and interactions are not
      synchronized} --- If checked, DrRacket warns the user on the first
      interaction after the definitions window, language, or teachpack
      is changed without a corresponding click on @onscreen{Run}.
      Otherwise, the warning appears on every interaction.}

@item{@PrefItem{Ask about clearing test coverage} --- If checked, when
      test coverage annotations are displayed DrRacket prompts about
      removing them.  This setting only applies to the PLT languages.
      DrRacket never asks in the teaching languages.}

@item{@PrefItem{Check for newer Racket versions} --- If checked,
      DrRacket periodically polls a server to determine whether a newer
      version of DrRacket is available.}

]


@section{@onscreen{General}}

@itemize[

@item{@PrefItem{Number of recent items} --- controls the length of the
      @onscreen{Open Recent} menu (in the @onscreen{File} menu).}

@item{@PrefItem{Auto-save files} --- If checked, the editor generates
      autosave files (see @secref["drracket-autosave-files"]) for files
      that have not been saved after five minutes.}

@item{@PrefItem{Backup files} --- If checked, when saving a file for the
      first time in each editing session, the original copy of the file
      is copied to a backup file in the same directory.  The backup
      files have the same name as the original, except that they end in
      either @indexed-file{.bak} or @indexed-file{~}.}

@item{@PrefItem{Show status-line} --- If checked, DrRacket shows a
      status line at the bottom of each window.}

@item{@PrefItem{Count column numbers from one} --- If checked, the
      status line's column counter counts from one.  Otherwise, it
      counts from zero.}

@item{@PrefItem{Display line numbers in buffer; not character offsets}
      --- If checked, the status line shows a
      @nonterm{line}:@nonterm{column} display for the current selection
      rather than the character offset into the text.}

@item{@PrefItem{Automatically print to PostScript file} --- If checked,
      printing will automatically save PostScript files.  If not,
      printing will use the standard printing mechanisms for your
      computer.}

@item{@PrefItem{Open files in separate tabs (not separate windows)} ---
      If checked, DrRacket will use tabs in the front-most window to
      open new files, rather than creating new windows for new files.}

@item{@PrefItem{Automatically open interactions window when running a
      program} --- If checked, DrRacket shows the interactions window
      (if it is hidden) when a program is run.}

@item{@PrefItem{Automatically switch to the module language when opening
      a module} --- If checked, DrRacket will recognize files that have
      a @tt{#lang} line and adjust the language setting automatically.}

@item{@PrefItem{Put the interactions window beside the definitions
      window} --- If checked, DrRacket puts the interactions window to
      the right of the definitions window.  By default, the interactions
      window is below the definitions window.}

@item{@PrefItem{Always show the #lang line in the Module language} ---
      If checked, the module language always shows the @hash-lang[] line
      (even when it would ordinarily be scrolled off of the page),
      assuming that the @hash-lang[] line is the first line in the file.}

@section{@onscreen{Profiling}}

This preference panel configures the profiling report.  The band of
color shows the range of colors that profiled functions take on.  Colors
near the right are used for code that is not invoked often and colors on
the right are used for code that is invoked often.

If you are interested in more detail at the low end, choose the
@onscreen{Square root} check box.  If you are interested in more detail
at the upper end, choose the @onscreen{Square} check box.


@section{@onscreen{Browser}}

This preferences panel allows you to configure your HTTP proxy.  Contact
your system administrator for details.


@section{@onscreen{Tools}}

This preference panel allows you to configure the currently active
plugins.
