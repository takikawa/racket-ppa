;; Windows has a bug when using `shell-execute' or when running `iexplore.exe'

;; It seems that the IE7 problem happens either way (`shell-execute' or running
;; directly) -- but it also happens with firefox when using `shell-execute'.
;; One possible solution is to run `ftype http' to find the default browser
;; command, and if it uses `iexplore.exe' then change it to `explorer.exe', and
;; run the resulting command directly.  This is described at
;;   http://www.tutorials-win.com/IE/Lauching-HTML/
;; But this still fails on Vista, since the problem there is that launching a
;; browser with a file:// URL makes it start a more priviliged process, and
;; doing that drops the fragment again.  So the solution that the code below
;; implements is to write and use (via `send-url/contents') a trampoline html
;; that redirects to the actual file and fragment.
