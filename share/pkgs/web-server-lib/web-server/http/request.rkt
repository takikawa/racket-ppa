;;
;; Before you edit anything in this file, keep in mind that some clients
;; are malicious, therefore all clients must be treated as such and
;; their input MUST NOT be trusted. In that vein, avoid procedures such
;; as `read-{,bytes-}line' and `read-bytes' because they allocate memory
;; up front based on input from the client. Always consume client input
;; by buffering it in (relatively) small chunks.
;;
;; Happy hacking!
