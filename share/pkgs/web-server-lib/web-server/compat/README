Each directory contains a README describing backwards incompatible changes to the Web Server and instructions for using the compatibility interface in newer versions.

Most compatibility interfaces mirror the structure of the Web Server collection. For example, to require the version of web-server/http/cookie before backwards incompatible change 0, require web-server/compat/0/http/cookie.

These compatibility interfaces are not documented in the manual to discourage new programs from using the old interface.
