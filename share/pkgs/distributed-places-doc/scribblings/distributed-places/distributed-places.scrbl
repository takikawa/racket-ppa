@defmodule[racket/place/distributed]

Distributed places support programs whose computation may span
physical machines. The design relies on machine @deftech{nodes} that
perform computation.  The programmer configures a new distributed
system using a declarative syntax and callbacks.  A node begins life
with one initial place: the @deftech{message router}. @;{See
@figure-ref["node-places"].} After a node has been configured, its
message router is activated by calling the @racket[message-router]
function. The message router listens on a TCP port for incoming
connections from other nodes in the distributed system. Places can be
spawned within the node by sending place-spawn request messages to the
node's message router.

The distributed places implementation relies on two assumptions:

@itemlist[
@item{The user's @filepath{.ssh/config} and
 @filepath{.ssh/authorized_keys} files are configured correctly to
 allow passwordless connection to remote hosts via public key authentication.}
@item{Distributed places does not support the specification of ssh usernames.
 If a non-default ssh username is required the @filepath{.ssh/config} file
 should be used to specifiy the username.}
@item{All machines run the same version of Racket.  Futures versions of distributed
 places may use the zo binary data format for serialization.}
]

The following example illustrates a configuration and use of
distributed places that starts a new node on the current machine and
passes it a @racket["Hello World"] string:

@section{Define Remote Server}

@defmodule[racket/place/define-remote-server]

@deftogether[(@defform[(define-remote-server [name identifier?] rpc-forms ...+)]
              @defform[(define-named-remote-server [name identifier?] rpc-forms ...+)])]{
The @racket[define-remote-server] and @racket[define-named-remote-server] forms
are nearly identical.  The @racket[define-remote-server] form should be used
with @racket[supervise-dynamic-place-at] to build a private rpc server, while
the @racket[define-named-remote-server] form should be used with
@racket[supervise-named-dynamic-place-at] to build a rpc server inside a named
place.

The @racket[define-named-remote-server] form takes an identifier and a
list of custom expressions as its arguments.  From the identifier a
function is created by prepending the @tt{make-} prefix. This
procedure takes a single argument a @racket[place-channel]. In the
example below, the @racket[make-tuple-server] identifier is the
@racket[place-function-name] given to the
@racket[supervise-named-dynamic-place-at] form to spawn an rpc server.
The server created by the @racket[make-tuple-server] procedure sits in
a loop waiting for rpc requests from the @racket[define-rpc] functions
documented below.

@defform[(define-state id value)]{
 Expands to a @@racket[define], which is closed over by the @racket[define-rpc] functions
 to form local state.
}

@defform[(define-rpc (id args ...) body ...)]{
 Expands to a client rpc function @tt{name-id} which sends @racket[id] and @racket[args ...] to
 the rpc server @racket[rpc-place] and waits for a response.
 @racket[(define (name-id rpc-place args ...) body)]
}

@defform[(define-cast (id args ...) body ...)]{
 Expands to a client rpc function @tt{name-id} which sends @racket[id] and @racket[args ...] to
 the rpc server @racket[rpc-place] but does not receive any response. A cast is a one-way communication
 technique.
 @racket[(define (name-id rpc-place args ...) body)]
}

The
@racket[define-state] custom form translates into a simple
@racket[define] form, which is closed over by the @racket[define-rpc]
forms.

The @racket[define-rpc] form is expanded into two parts. The first
part is the client stubs that call the rpc functions. The client
function name is formed by concatenating the
@racket[define-named-remote-server] identifier, @tt{tuple-server},
with the RPC function name @tt{set} to form @racket[tuple-server-set].
The RPC client functions take a destination argument which is a
@racket[remote-connection%] descriptor and then the RPC function
arguments. The RPC client function sends the RPC function name,
@racket[set], and the RPC arguments to the destination by calling an
internal function @racket[named-place-channel-put]. The RPC client
then calls @racket[named-place-channel-get] to wait for the RPC
response.

The second expansion part of @racket[define-rpc] is the server
implementation of the RPC call.  The server is implemented by a match
expression inside the @racket[make-tuple-server] function.  The match
clause for @racket[tuple-server-set] matches on messages beginning
with the @racket['set] symbol. The server executes the RPC call with
the communicated arguments and sends the result back to the RPC
client.

The @racket[define-cast] form is similar to the @racket[define-rpc] form
except there is no reply message from the server to client
