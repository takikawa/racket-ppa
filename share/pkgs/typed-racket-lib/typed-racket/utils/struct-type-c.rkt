;; struct-type/c generates contracts which protect structure type
;; descriptors. These descriptors can be used reflectively to create
;; constructors, accessors, mutators, predicates, and other
;; structure-related functions.

;; Currently, this is a very simple implentation which always rejects
;; all reflective access. A better implementation would check that the
;; procedures created by reflective access to the structure obey
;; appropriate invariants.
