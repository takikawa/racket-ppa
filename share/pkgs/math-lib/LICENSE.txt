The math collection is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL), just like the majority of Racket's libraries.  This
means that you can link this package into proprietary applications,
provided you follow the rules stated in the LGPL.  You can also modify
this package; if you distribute a modified version, you must distribute
it under the terms of the LGPL, which in particular means that you must
release the source code for the modified software.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html for more information.

Some of the math library code is derived from the C++ project Boost,
from source files released under the Boost Software License Version 1.0
(BSLv1.0). This license is compatible with the LGPLv3, provided the
BSLv1.0 license text is distributed along with any source code derived
from BSLv1.0 works.

Some of the math library is derived from ubiquitous C libraries released
under a license with similar terms.
