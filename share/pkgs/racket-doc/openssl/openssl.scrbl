@defmodule[openssl]

The @racketmodname[openssl] library provides glue for the OpenSSL
library with the Racket port system. It provides functions nearly
identically to the standard TCP subsystem in Racket, plus a
generic @racket[ports->ssl-ports] interface.

To use this library, you will need OpenSSL installed on your machine,
but on many platforms the necessary libraries are included with the OS
or with the Racket distribution. In particular:

@itemize[

@item{For Windows, @racketmodname[openssl] depends on
@filepath{libeay32.dll} and @filepath{ssleay32.dll}, which are
included in the Racket distribution for Windows.}

@item{For Mac OS, @racketmodname[openssl] depends on
@filepath{libssl.dylib} and @filepath{libcrypto.dylib}. Although those
libraries are provided by Mac OS 10.2 and later, their use is
deprecated, so the Racket distribution for Mac OS includes newer
versions.}

@item{For Unix, @racketmodname[openssl] depends on
@filepath{libssl.so} and @filepath{libcrypto.so}, which must be
installed in a standard library location or in a directory listed by
@envvar{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}. These libraries are included in many OS
distributions.}

]

@defthing[ssl-available? boolean?]{

A boolean value that reports whether the system OpenSSL library was
successfully loaded. Calling @racket[ssl-connect], @|etc| when this
value is @racket[#f] (library not loaded) will raise an exception.}


@defthing[ssl-load-fail-reason (or/c #f string?)]{

Either @racket[#f] (when @racket[ssl-available?] is @racket[#t]) or an
error string (when @racket[ssl-available?] is @racket[#f]).}

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@section{TCP-like Client Procedures}

Use @racket[ssl-connect] or @racket[ssl-connect/enable-break] to
create an SSL connection over TCP. To create a secure connection,
supply the result of @racket[ssl-secure-client-context] or create a
client context with @racket[ssl-make-client-context] and configure it
using the functions described in @secref["cert-procs"].

@defproc[(ssl-connect [hostname string?]
                      [port-no (integer-in 1 65535)]
                      [client-protocol
                       (or/c ssl-client-context?
                             'secure
                             'auto
                             'sslv2-or-v3 'sslv2 'sslv3 'tls 'tls11 'tls12)
                       'auto])
         (values input-port? output-port?)]{

Connect to the host given by @racket[hostname], on the port given by
@racket[port-no]. This connection will be encrypted using SSL.  The
return values are as for @racket[tcp-connect]: an input port and an
output port.

The default @racket['auto] protocol is @bold{insecure}. Use
@racket['secure] for a secure connection. See
@racket[ssl-secure-client-context] for details.

The optional @racket[client-protocol] argument determines which
encryption protocol is used, whether the server's certificate is
checked, etc. The argument can be either a client context created by
@racket[ssl-make-client-context] a symbol specifying the protocol to
use; see @racket[ssl-make-client-context] for further details,
including the meanings of the protocol symbols.

Closing the resulting output port does not send a shutdown message to
the server. See also @racket[ports->ssl-ports].

If hostname verification is enabled (see
@racket[ssl-set-verify-hostname!]), the peer's certificate is checked
against @racket[hostname].

@;{
See `enforce-retry?' in "mzssl.rkt", currently set to #f so that this
paragraph does not apply:
Beware that the SSL protocol allows reading or writing in only one
direction at a time. If you request data from the input port, then
data cannot be written to the output port (i.e., attempting to write
will block) until the other end of the connection responds to the
read. Even merely checking for input data --- using
@racket[byte-ready?], for example --- commits the connection to
reading, and the other end must respond with a (possibly zero-length)
answer. Protocols that work with SSL, such as IMAP, have a
well-defined communication pattern, where theres no question of
whether the other end is supposed to be sending or reading data.
}

Like @racket[ssl-connect], but breaking is enabled while trying to
connect.}


@defproc[(ssl-secure-client-context)
         ssl-client-context?]{

Returns a client context that verifies certificates using the default
verification sources from @racket[(ssl-default-verify-sources)],
verifies hostnames, and avoids using weak ciphers. The result is
essentially equivalent to the following:

@racketblock[
(let ([ctx (ssl-make-client-context 'auto)])
  (code:comment "Load default verification sources (root certificates)")
  (ssl-load-default-verify-sources! ctx)
  (code:comment "Require certificate verification")
  (ssl-set-verify! ctx #t)
  (code:comment "Require hostname verification")
  (ssl-set-verify-hostname! ctx #t)
  (code:comment "No weak cipher suites")
  (ssl-set-ciphers! ctx "DEFAULT:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT:!SSLv2")
  (code:comment "Seal context so further changes cannot weaken it")
  (ssl-seal-context! ctx)
  ctx)
]

The context is cached, so different calls to
@racket[ssl-secure-client-context] return the same context unless
@racket[(ssl-default-verify-sources)] has changed.

Note that @racket[(ssl-secure-client-context)] returns a sealed
context, so it is not possible to add a private key and certificate
chain to it. If client credentials are required, use
@racket[ssl-make-client-context] instead.

          [#:certificate-chain certificate-chain (or/c path-string? #f) #f])
         ssl-client-context?]{

Creates a context to be supplied to @racket[ssl-connect]. The context
is @bold{insecure} unless @racket['secure] is supplied or additional steps are taken; see
@racket[ssl-secure-client-context] for details.

The client context identifies a communication protocol (as selected by
@racket[protocol]), and also holds certificate information (i.e., the
client's identity, its trusted certificate authorities, etc.). See the
section @secref["cert-procs"] below for more information on
certificates.

The @racket[protocol] should be one of the following:
@itemize[
@item{@racket['secure] : Equivalent to @racket[(ssl-secure-client-context)].}
@item{@racket['auto] : Automatically negotiates the protocol version
from those that this library considers sufficiently secure---currently
TLS versions 1.0 and higher, but subject to change.}
@item{@racket['tls12] : Only TLS protocol version 1.2.}
]
Note that later TLS versions are supported, but there is no corresponding
@racket[protocol] symbol; using @racket['secure] is best and forward-compatible.
The following @racket[protocol] symbols are deprecated but still supported:
@itemlist[
@item{@racket['sslv2-or-v3] : Alias for @racket['auto]. Note that
despite the name, neither SSL 2.0 nor 3.0 are considered sufficiently
secure, so this @racket[protocol] no longer allows either of them.}
@item{@racket['sslv2] : SSL protocol version 2.0. @bold{Insecure.}
Note that SSL 2.0 support has been removed from many platforms.}
@item{@racket['sslv3] : SSL protocol version 3.0. @bold{Insecure.}}
@item{@racket['tls] : Only TLS protocol version 1.0.}
@item{@racket['tls11] : Only TLS protocol version 1.1.}
]

Not all protocol versions are supported by all servers. The
@racket['secure] and @racket['auto] options offer broad compatibility at a reasonable level
of security. Note that the security of connections depends on more
than the protocol version; see @racket[ssl-secure-client-context] for
details. See also
@racket[supported-client-protocols] and
@racket[supported-server-protocols].

If @racket[private-key] and @racket[certificate-chain] are provided,
they are loaded into the context using @racket[ssl-load-private-key!]
and @racket[ssl-load-certificate-chain!], respectively. Client
credentials are rarely used with HTTPS, but they are occasionally used
in other kind of servers.

Like @racket[tcp-listen], but the result is an SSL listener. The extra optional
@racket[server-protocol] is as for @racket[ssl-connect], except that a
context must be a server context instead of a client context, and
@racket['secure] is simply an alias for @racket['auto].

Call @racket[ssl-load-certificate-chain!] and
@racket[ssl-load-private-key!] to avoid a @emph{no shared cipher}
error on accepting connections. The file @filepath{test.pem} in the
@filepath{openssl} collection is a suitable argument for both calls
when testing. Since @filepath{test.pem} is public, however, such a
test configuration obviously provides no security.

An SSL listener is a synchronizable value (see @racket[sync]). It is
ready---with itself as its value---when the underlying TCP listener is
ready. At that point, however, accepting a connection with
@racket[ssl-accept] may not complete immediately, because
further communication is needed to establish the connection.

Returns two values---an input port and an output port---that
implement the SSL protocol over the given input and output port. (The
given ports should be connected to another process that runs the SSL
protocol.)

The @racket[mode] argument can be @racket['connect] or
@racket['accept]. The mode determines how the SSL protocol is
initialized over the ports, either as a client or as a server. As with
@racket[ssl-listen], in @racket['accept] mode, supply a
@racket[context] that has been initialized with
@racket[ssl-load-certificate-chain!] and
@racket[ssl-load-private-key!] to avoid a @emph{no shared cipher}
error.

The @racket[context] argument should be a client context for
@racket['connect] mode or a server context for @racket['accept]
mode. If it is not supplied, a context is created using the protocol
specified by a @racket[protocol] argument.

If the @racket[protocol] argument is not supplied, it defaults to
@racket['auto]. See @racket[ssl-make-client-context] for
further details (including all options and the meanings of the
protocol symbols).  This argument is ignored if a @racket[context]
argument is supplied.

If @racket[close-original?] is true, then when both SSL ports are
closed, the given input and output ports are automatically closed.

If @racket[shutdown-on-close?] is true, then when the output SSL port
is closed, it sends a shutdown message to the other end of the SSL
connection. When shutdown is enabled, closing the
output port can fail if the given output port becomes unwritable
(e.g., because the other end of the given port has been closed by
another process).

The @racket[error] argument is an error procedure to use for raising
communication errors. The default is @racket[error], which raises
@racket[exn:fail]; in contrast, @racket[ssl-accept] and
@racket[ssl-connect] use an error function that raises
@racket[exn:fail:network].

See also @racket[ssl-connect] about the limitations of reading and
writing to an SSL connection (i.e., one direction at a time).

If hostname verification is enabled (see
@racket[ssl-set-verify-hostname!]), the peer's certificate is checked
against @racket[hostname].

Loads a PEM-format certification chain file for connections to made
with the given server context (created by
@racket[ssl-make-server-context]) or listener (created by
@racket[ssl-listen]). A certificate chain can also be loaded into a
client context (created by @racket[ssl-make-client-context]) when
connecting to a server requiring client credentials, but that
situation is uncommon.

This chain is used to identify the client or server when it connects
or accepts connections. Loading a chain overwrites the old chain. Also
call @racket[ssl-load-private-key!] to load the certificate's
corresponding key.

You can use the file @filepath{test.pem} of the @filepath{openssl}

such a test configuration obviously provides no security.

the client or server. Like @racket[ssl-load-certificate-chain!], this

with client contexts.

If @racket[rsa?] is @racket[#t] (the default), the first RSA key is
read (i.e., non-RSA keys are skipped). If @racket[asn1?] is
@racket[#t], the file is parsed as ASN1 format instead of PEM.

Provides an SSL server context with a procedure it can use for switching
to alternative contexts on a per-connection basis. The procedure is given
the hostname the client was attempting to connect to, to use as the basis
for its decision.

The client sends this information via the TLS
@hyperlink["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication"]{Server Name Identification}
extension, which was created to allow @hyperlink["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting"]{virtual hosting}
for secure servers.

The suggested use it to prepare the appropriate server contexts, 
define a single callback which can dispatch between them, and then
apply it to all the contexts before sealing them. A minimal example:

@racketblock[
  (define ctx-a (ssl-make-server-context 'tls))
  (define ctx-b (ssl-make-server-context 'tls))
  ...
  (ssl-load-certificate-chain! ctx-a "cert-a.pem")
  (ssl-load-certificate-chain! ctx-b "cert-b.pem")
  ...
  (ssl-load-private-key! ctx-a "key-a.pem")
  (ssl-load-private-key! ctx-b "key-b.pem")
  ...
  (define (callback hostname)
    (cond [(equal? hostname "a") ctx-a]
          [(equal? hostname "b") ctx-b]
          ...
          [else #f]))
  (ssl-set-server-name-identification-callback! ctx-a callback)
  (ssl-set-server-name-identification-callback! ctx-b callback)
  ...
  (ssl-seal-context! ctx-a)
  (ssl-seal-context! ctx-b)
  ...
  (ssl-listen 443 5 #t #f ctx-a)
]

If the callback returns @racket[#f], the connection attempt will continue,
using the original server context.
