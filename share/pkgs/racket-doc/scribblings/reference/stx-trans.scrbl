@racket[transformer].}


@defthing[prop:set!-transformer struct-type-property?]{

A @tech{structure type property} to identify structure types that act
as @tech{assignment transformers} like the ones created by
@racket[make-set!-transformer].

The property value must be an exact integer or procedure of one or two
arguments. In the former case, the integer designates a field within
the structure that should contain a procedure; the integer must be
between @racket[0] (inclusive) and the number of non-automatic fields
in the structure type (exclusive, not counting supertype fields), and
the designated field must also be specified as immutable.

If the property value is a procedure of one argument, then the
procedure serves as a @tech{syntax transformer} and for @racket[set!]
transformations. If the property value is a procedure of two
arguments, then the first argument is the structure whose type has
@racket[prop:set!-transformer] property, and the second argument is a
syntax object as for a @tech{syntax transformer} and for @racket[set!]
transformations; @racket[set!-transformer-procedure] applied to the
structure produces a new function that accepts just the syntax object
and calls the procedure associated through the property. Finally, if the
property value is an integer, the target identifier is extracted from
the structure instance; if the field value is not a procedure of one
argument, then a procedure that always calls
@racket[raise-syntax-error] is used, instead.

If a value has both the @racket[prop:set!-transformer] and
@racket[prop:rename-transformer] properties, then the latter takes
precedence. If a structure type has the @racket[prop:set!-transformer]
and @racket[prop:procedure] properties, then the former takes
precedence for the purposes of macro expansion.}

 @item{If @racket[provide] exports @racket[_id], it uses a

         syntax?]{

Expands @racket[stx] in the lexical context of the expression
currently being expanded. The @racket[context-v] argument is used as
the result of @racket[syntax-local-context] for immediate expansions;
a list indicates an @tech{internal-definition context}, and more
information on the form of the list is below.

When an identifier in @racket[stop-ids] is encountered by the expander
in a sub-expression, expansions stops for the sub-expression. If
@racket[stop-ids] is a non-empty list and does not contain just @racket[module*], then
@racket[begin], @racket[quote], @racket[set!], @racket[lambda],
@racket[case-lambda], @racket[let-values], @racket[letrec-values],
@racket[if], @racket[begin0], @racket[with-continuation-mark],
@racket[letrec-syntaxes+values], @racket[#%app],
@racket[#%expression], @racket[#%top], and
@racket[#%variable-reference] are added to @racket[stop-ids].  If
@racket[#%app], @racket[#%top], or @racket[#%datum] appears in
@racket[stop-ids], then application, top-level variable reference, and
literal data expressions without the respective explicit form are not
wrapped with the explicit form. If @racket[stop-ids] is @racket[#f]
instead of a list, then @racket[stx] is expanded only as long as the
outermost form of @racket[stx] is a macro (i.e., expansion does not
proceed to sub-expressions). A fully expanded form can include the
bindings listed in @secref["fully-expanded"] plus the
@racket[letrec-syntaxes+values] form and @racket[#%expression]
in any expression position.

When @racket[#%plain-module-begin] is not itself in @racket[stop-ids]
and @racket[module*] is in @racket[stop-ids], then the
@racket[#%plain-module-begin] transformer refrains from expanding
@racket[module*] sub-forms. Otherwise, the
@racket[#%plain-module-begin] transformer detects and expands sub-forms
(such as @racket[define-values]) independent of the corresponding
identifier's presence in @racket[stop-ids].

When @racket[context-v] is @racket['module-begin], and the result of
expansion is a @racket[#%plain-module-begin] form, then a
@racket['submodule] @tech{syntax property} is added to each enclosed
@racket[module] form (but not @racket[module*] forms) in the same way as by
@racket[module] expansion.

The optional @racket[intdef-ctx] argument must be either @racket[#f],
the result of @racket[syntax-local-make-definition-context], or a list
of such results. In the latter two cases, lexical information for
internal definitions is added to @racket[stx] before it is expanded
(in reverse order relative to the list). The lexical information is
also added to the expansion result (because the expansion might
introduce bindings or references to internal-definition bindings).

For a particular @tech{internal-definition context}, generate a unique
value and put it into a list for @racket[context-v]. To allow
@tech{liberal expansion} of @racket[define] forms, the generated value
should be an instance of a structure with a true value for
@racket[prop:liberal-define-context]. If the internal-definition
context is meant to be self-contained, the list for @racket[context-v]
should contain only the generated value; if the internal-definition
context is meant to splice into an immediately enclosing context, then
when @racket[syntax-local-context] produces a list, @racket[cons] the
generated value onto that list.

Like @racket[local-expand] given @racket['expression] and an empty
stop list, but with two results: a syntax object for the fully
expanded expression, and a syntax object whose content is opaque. The
latter can be used in place of the former (perhaps in a larger
expression produced by a macro transformer), and when the macro
expander encounters the opaque object, it substitutes the fully
expanded expression without re-expanding it; the
@exnraise[exn:fail:syntax] if the expansion context includes bindings
or marks that were not present for the original expansion, in which
case re-expansion might produce different results. Consistent use of
@racket[syntax-local-expand-expression] and the opaque object thus
avoids quadratic expansion times when local expansions are nested.

A run-time expression within a module is lifted to the module's top
level, just before the expression whose expansion requests the
lift. Similarly, a run-time expression outside of a module is lifted
to a top-level definition. A compile-time expression in a
@racket[letrec-syntaxes+values] or @racket[define-syntaxes] binding is
lifted to a @racket[let] wrapper around the corresponding right-hand
side of the binding. A compile-time expression within
@racket[begin-for-syntax] is lifted to a @racket[define]
declaration just before the requesting expression within the 
@racket[begin-for-syntax].

Other syntactic forms can capture lifts by using
@racket[local-expand/capture-lifts] or
@racket[local-transformer-expand/capture-lifts].

Returns a value that represents the target for expressions lifted via
@racket[syntax-local-lift-expression]. That is, for different
transformer calls for which this procedure returns the same value (as
determined by @racket[eq?]), lifted expressions for the two
transformer are moved to the same place. Thus, the result is useful
for caching lift information to avoid redundant lifts.

@defproc[(syntax-local-lift-module-end-declaration [stx syntax?])
         void?]{

Cooperates with the @racket[module] form to insert @racket[stx] as
a top-level declaration at the end of the module currently being
expanded. If the current expression being
transformed is in @tech{phase level} 0 and not in the module top-level, then @racket[stx] is
eventually expanded in an expression context. If the current expression being
transformed is in a higher @tech{phase level} (i.e., nested within some
number of @racket[begin-for-syntax]es within a module top-level), then the lifted declaration
is placed at the very end of the module (under a suitable number of
@racket[begin-for-syntax]es), instead of merely the end of the
enclosing @racket[begin-for-syntax].

@racket[raw-require-spec] (either as a @tech{syntax object} or datum)
to the top-level or to the top of the module currently being expanded

The resulting syntax object is the same as @racket[stx], except that a
fresh @tech{syntax mark} is added. The same @tech{syntax mark} is
added to the lifted @racket[#%require] form, so that the
@racket[#%require] form can bind uses of imported identifiers in the
resulting syntax object (assuming that the lexical information of
@racket[stx] includes the binding environment into which the
@racket[#%require] is lifted).

If @racket[raw-require-spec] and @racket[stx] are part of the input to
a transformer, then typically @racket[syntax-local-introduce] should be
applied to each before passing them to
@racket[syntax-local-lift-require], and then
@racket[syntax-local-introduce] should be applied to the result of
@racket[syntax-local-lift-require]. Otherwise, marks added

The symbol results indicate that the expression is being expanded for
an @tech{expression context}, a @tech{top-level context}, a

A list result indicates expansion in an @tech{internal-definition

first value if and only if they are invoked for the same

Otherwise, the result is the same as @racket[id-stx] with its module
bindings (if any) removed from its lexical information, and the
lexical information of the current @tech{module context} (if any)

Thus, the result is an identifier corresponding to the innermost

A @tech{transformer binding} whose value is a structure with the
@racket[prop:provide-transformer] property implements a derived
@racket[_provide-spec] for @racket[provide] as a @deftech{provide transformer}.
A @tech{provide transformer} is applied as part of the last phase of
a module's expansion, after all other declarations and expressions within
the module are expanded.

A @tech{transformer binding} whose value is a structure with the
@racket[prop:provide-pre-transformer] property implements a derived
@racket[_provide-spec] for @racket[provide] as a @deftech{provide
pre-transformer}.  A @tech{provide pre-transformer} is applied as part
of the first phase of a module's expansion. Since it is used in the
first phase, a @tech{provide pre-transformer} can use functions such
as @racket[syntax-local-lift-expression] to introduce expressions and
definitions in the enclosing module.

An identifier can have a @tech{transformer binding} to a value that
acts both as a @tech{provide transformer} and @tech{provide
pre-transformer}. The result of a @tech{provide
pre-transformer} is @emph{not} automatically re-expanded, so a
@tech{provide pre-transformer} can usefully expand to itself in that case.

A transformer is called with the syntax object representing its use as
a @racket[_provide-spec] within a @racket[provide] form and a list of
symbols representing the export modes specified by enclosing
@racket[_provide-spec]s. The result of a @tech{provide transformer}
must be a list of @racket[export]s, while the result of a
@tech{provide pre-transformer} is a syntax object to be used as a
@racket[_provide-spec] in the last phase of module expansion.

If a derived form contains a sub-form that is a
@racket[_provide-spec], then it can call @racket[expand-export] or
@racket[pre-expand-export] to transform the sub-@racket[_provide-spec]
sub-form.

Reports the value of a syntax property that can be
attached to an identifier by the expansion of a keyword-application
form. See @racket[lambda] for more
information about the property.

The property value is normally a pair consisting of the original
identifier and an identifier that appears in the
expansion. Property-value merging via @racket[syntax-track-origin] can make
the value a pair of such values, and so on.}
