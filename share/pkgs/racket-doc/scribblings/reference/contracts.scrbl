The contract system guards one part of a program from
another. Programmers specify the behavior of a module's exports via
@racket[(provide (contract-out ....))], and the contract system enforces those
constraints.

@deftech{Contracts} come in two forms: those constructed by the
various operations listed in this section of the manual, and various
ordinary Racket values that double as contracts, including
@itemize[
@item{@tech{symbols}, @tech{booleans}, @tech{characters}, @tech{keywords}, and
@racket[null], which are treated as contracts that recognize
themselves, using @racket[eq?], }

@item{@tech{strings}, @tech{byte strings}, @racket[+nan.0], and
       @racket[+nan.f], which are treated as contracts
that recognize themselves using @racket[equal?], }

@item{@tech{numbers} (except @racket[+nan.0] and
       @racket[+nan.f]), which are treated as contracts
that recognize themselves using @racket[=],}

@item{@tech{regular expressions}, which are treated as contracts
       that recognize @tech{byte strings} and @tech{strings} that
       match the regular expression, and }

@item{predicates: any procedure of arity 1 is treated as a
predicate. During contract checking, it is applied to the values that
appear and should return @racket[#f] to indicate that the contract
failed, and anything else to indicate it passed.}

]

@deftech{Contract combinators} are functions such as @racket[->] and
@racket[listof] that take contracts and produce other contracts.

Contracts in Racket are subdivided into three different categories:
@;
@itemlist[@item{@deftech{Flat contract}s can be fully checked immediately for
                 a given value. These kinds of contracts are essentially
                 predicate functions. Using @racket[flat-contract-predicate],
                 you can extract the predicate from an arbitrary flat contract; some
                 flat contracts can be applied like functions, in which case
                 they accept a single argument and return @racket[#t] or
                 @racket[#f] to indicate if the given value would be accepted
                 by the contract. All of the flat contracts returned by functions
                 in this library can be used directly as predicates, but ordinary
                 Racket values that double as flat contracts (e.g., numbers or symbols)
                 cannot.
                 
                 The function @racket[flat-contract?] recognizes a flat contract.}
          @item{@deftech{Chaperone contracts} are not always immediately
                 checkable, but are guaranteed to not change any properties
                 of any values that they check. That is, they may wrap
                 a value in such a way that it signals contract violations
                 later, as the value is used (e.g., a function contract
                 checks the inputs and outputs to the function only when
                 the function is called and returned), but any properties
                 that the value had before being wrapped by the contract
                 are preserved by the contract wrapper. 
                 
                 All flat contracts are also chaperone contracts (but
                 not vice-versa).}
         @item{@deftech{Impersonator contracts} do not provide any 
                guarantees about values they check. Impersonator contracts
                may hide properties of values, or even make them completely
                opaque (e.g, @racket[new-âˆ€/c]).
                
                All contracts are impersonator contracts.}]

For more about this hierarchy, see @tech{chaperones} and
a research paper on chaperones, impersonators, and how they can be used to 
implement contracts @cite{Strickland12}.

         flat-contract?]{
Produces a contract like @racket[flat-contract], but with the name @racket[name].

For example,
@racketblock[(define/contract i
               (flat-named-contract
                'odd-integer
                (lambda (x) (and (integer? x) (odd? x))))
               2)]

The generator argument adds a generator for the flat-named-contract. See
@racket[contract-generate] for more information.
}

@defthing[any/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that accepts any value.

When using this contract as the result portion of a function contract,
consider using @racket[any] instead; using @racket[any] leads to
better memory performance, but it also allows multiple results.}


@defthing[none/c flat-contract?]{

A @tech{flat contract} that accepts no values.}


@defproc[(or/c [contract contract?] ...)
         contract?]{

Takes any number of contracts and returns
a contract that accepts any value that any one of the contracts
accepts individually.

The @racket[or/c] result tests any value by applying the contracts in
order, from left to right, with the exception that it always moves the
non-@tech{flat contracts} (if any) to the end, checking them
last. Thus, a contract such as @racket[(or/c (not/c real?)
positive?)] is guaranteed to only invoke the @racket[positive?]
predicate on real numbers.

If all of the arguments are procedures or @tech{flat contracts}, the
result is a @tech{flat contract}. If only one of the arguments is a
higher-order contract, the result is a contract that just checks the
flat contracts and, if they don't pass, applies the higher-order
contract.

If there are multiple higher-order contracts, @racket[or/c] uses
@racket[contract-first-order-passes?] to distinguish between
them. More precisely, when an @racket[or/c] is checked, it first
checks all of the @tech{flat contracts}. If none of them pass, it
calls @racket[contract-first-order-passes?] with each of the
higher-order contracts. If only one returns true, @racket[or/c] uses
that contract. If none of them return true, it signals a contract
violation. If more than one returns true, it also signals a contract
violation.
For example, this contract
@racketblock[
(or/c (-> number? number?)
      (-> string? string? string?))
]
does not accept a function like this one: @racket[(lambda args ...)]
since it cannot tell which of the two arrow contracts should be used
with the function.

If all of its arguments are @racket[list-contract?]s, then @racket[or/c]
returns a @racket[list-contract?].
}

@defproc[(and/c [contract contract?] ...) contract?]{

Takes any number of contracts and returns a contract that
accepts any value that satisfies all of the contracts simultaneously.

If all of the arguments are procedures or @tech{flat contracts},
the result is a @tech{flat contract}.

The contract produced by @racket[and/c] tests any value by applying
the contracts in order, from left to right.}


@defproc[(not/c [flat-contract flat-contract?]) flat-contract?]{

Accepts a flat contracts or a predicate and returns a flat contract
that checks the inverse of the argument.}


@defproc[(=/c [z real?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be a number and
@racket[=] to @racket[z].}


@defproc[(</c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be a number and
@racket[<] than @racket[n].}


@defproc[(>/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[>].}


@defproc[(<=/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[<=].}


@defproc[(>=/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[>=].}

@defproc[(between/c [n real?] [m real?])
flat-contract?]{ Returns a flat contract that requires the
input to be a real number between @racket[n] and @racket[m] or equal to
one of them.}

@defproc[(real-in [n real?] [m real?]) flat-contract?]{
An alias for @racket[between/c].}

@defproc[(integer-in [j exact-integer?] [k exact-integer?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be an exact integer
between @racket[j] and @racket[k], inclusive.}


@defthing[natural-number/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that requires the input to be an exact non-negative integer.}


@defproc[(string-len/c [len real?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that recognizes strings that have fewer than
@racket[len] characters.}


@defthing[false/c flat-contract?]{

An alias @racket[#f] for backwards compatibility.}


@defthing[printable/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that recognizes values that can be written out and
read back in with @racket[write] and @racket[read].}


@defproc[(one-of/c [v any/c] ...+) flat-contract?]{

Accepts any number of atomic values and returns a flat contract that
recognizes those values, using @racket[eqv?]  as the comparison
predicate.  For the purposes of @racket[one-of/c], atomic values are
defined to be: @tech{characters}, @tech{symbols}, @tech{booleans},
@racket[null], @tech{keywords}, @tech{numbers},
@|void-const|, and @|undefined-const|.

This is a backwards compatibility contract constructor. If
neither @|void-const| nor @|undefined-const| are arguments,
it simply passes its arguments to @racket[or/c].
}


@defproc[(symbols [sym symbol?] ...+) flat-contract?]{

Accepts any number of symbols and returns a flat contract that
recognizes those symbols.

This is a backwards compatibility constructor; it merely
passes its arguments to @racket[or/c].
}

@defproc[(vectorof [c contract?]
                   [#:immutable immutable (or/c #t #f 'dont-care) 'dont-care]
                   [#:flat? flat? boolean? #f])
         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes vectors. The elements of the vector must
match @racket[c].

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] argument must also be a flat contract.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable vectors, as they will not
check future operations on the vector.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] argument is
a flat contract, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] argument
is a chaperone contract, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[vectorof] contract is applied to a vector, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable vectors
and a @tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable vectors.}

Returns the same contract as @racket[(vectorof c #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
backwards compatibility.}

         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes vectors whose lengths match the number of
contracts given. Each element of the vector must match its corresponding contract.

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] arguments must also be flat contracts.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable vectors, as they will not
check future operations on the vector.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] arguments are
flat contracts, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] arguments
are chaperone contracts, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[vector/c] contract is applied to a vector, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable vectors

Returns the same contract as @racket[(vector/c c ... #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
reasons of backwards compatibility.}


@defproc[(box/c [c contract?]
                [#:immutable immutable (or/c #t #f 'dont-care) 'dont-care]
                [#:flat? flat? boolean? #f])
         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes boxes. The content of the box must match @racket[c].

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] argument must also be a flat contract.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable boxes, as they will not check
future operations on the box.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] argument is
a flat contract, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] argument is
a chaperone contract, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[box/c] contract is applied to a box, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable boxes
and either a @tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable boxes.}


@defproc[(box-immutable/c [c contract?]) contract?]{

Returns the same contract as @racket[(box/c c #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
reasons of backwards compatibility.}


@defproc[(listof [c contract?]) list-contract?]{

Returns a contract that recognizes a list whose every element matches
the contract @racket[c]. Beware that when this contract is applied to
a value, the result is not necessarily @racket[eq?] to the input.

@defproc[(list*of [c contract?]) contract?]{

Returns a contract that recognizes improper lists whose elements match

then its @racket[car] position is expected to match @racket[c] and
its @racket[cdr] position is expected to be @racket[(list*of c)]. Otherwise,
it is expected to match @racket[c]. Beware that when this contract is applied to

Produces a contract that recognizes instances of the structure
type named by @racket[struct-id], and whose field values match the
contracts produced by the @racket[field-spec]s.

If the @racket[field-spec] lists the names of other fields,
then the contract depends on values in those fields, and the @racket[contract-expr]
expression is evaluated each time a selector is applied, building a new contract
for the fields based on the values of the @racket[dep-field-name] fields (the
@racket[dep-field-name] syntax is the same as the @racket[field-name] syntax).
If the field is a dependent field and no @racket[contract-type] annotation
appears, then it is assumed that the contract is
a chaperone, but not always a flat contract (and thus the entire @racket[struct/dc]
contract is not a flat contract).
If this is not the case, and the contract is
always flat then the field must be annotated with
the @racket[#:flat], or the field must be annotated with
@racket[#:impersonator] (in which case, it must be a mutable field).

A @racket[field-name] is either an identifier naming a field in the first
case, an identifier naming a selector in the second case indicated
by the @racket[#:selector] keyword, or
a field id for a struct that is a parent of @racket[struct-id], indicated
by the @racket[#:parent] keyword.

If the @racket[#:lazy] keyword appears, then the contract
on the field is check lazily (only when a selector is applied);
@racket[#:lazy] contracts cannot be put on mutable fields.

If a dependent contract depends on some mutable state, then use the
@racket[#:depends-on-state] keyword argument (if a field's dependent contract
depends on a mutable field, this keyword is automatically inferred).
The presence of this keyword means that the contract expression is evaluated
each time the corresponding field is accessed (or mutated, if it is a mutable
field). Otherwise, the contract expression for a dependent field contract
is evaluated when the contract is applied to a value.

If the @racket[#:inv] clause appears, then the invariant expression is 
evaluated (and must return a non-@racket[#f] value) when the contract
is applied to a struct.

Contracts for immutable fields must be either flat or chaperone contracts.
Contracts for mutable fields may be impersonator contracts.
If all fields are immutable and the @racket[contract-expr]s evaluate
to flat contracts, a flat contract is produced.  If all the
@racket[contract-expr]s are chaperone contracts, a chaperone contract is
produced.  Otherwise, an impersonator contract is produced.

As an example, the function @racket[bst/c] below
returns a contract for binary search trees whose values
are all between @racket[lo] and @racket[hi].
The lazy annotations ensure that this contract does not
change the running time of operations that do not
inspect the entire tree.

@racketblock[(struct bt (val left right))
             (define (bst/c lo hi)
               (or/c #f
                     (struct/dc bt

                                [right (val) #:lazy (bst val hi)])))]

@section[#:tag "function-contracts"]{Function Contracts}
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/base]

A @deftech{function contract} wraps a procedure to delay
checks for its arguments and results. There are three
primary function contract combinators that have increasing
amounts of expressiveness and increasing additional
overheads. The first @racket[->] is the cheapest. It
generates wrapper functions that can call the original
function directly. Contracts built with @racket[->*] require
packaging up arguments as lists in the wrapper function and
then using either @racket[keyword-apply] or
@racket[apply]. Finally, @racket[->i]
is the most expensive (along with @racket[->d]),
because it requires delaying the evaluation of the contract
expressions for the domain and range until the function
itself is called or returns.

The @racket[case->] contract is a specialized contract,
designed to match @racket[case-lambda] and
@racket[unconstrained-domain->] allows range checking
without requiring that the domain have any particular shape
(see below for an example use).

@defform*/subs[#:literals (any values)
               [(-> dom ... range)]
               ([dom dom-expr (code:line keyword dom-expr)]
                [range range-expr (values range-expr ...) any])]{

Produces a contract for a function that accepts a fixed
number of arguments and returns either a fixed number of
results or completely unspecified results (the latter when
@racket[any] is specified).

Each @racket[dom-expr] is a contract on an argument to a
function, and each @racket[range-expr] is a contract on a
result of the function.

@margin-note{Using a @racket[->] between two whitespace-delimited
@racketparenfont{.}s is the same as putting the @racket[->] right
after the enclosing opening parenthesis. See
@guidesecref["lists-and-syntax"] or @secref["parse-pair"] for more
information.}

For example,

@racketblock[(integer? boolean? . -> . integer?)]

produces a contract on functions of two arguments. The first argument
must be an integer, and the second argument must be a boolean. The
function must produce an integer.

A domain specification may include a keyword. If so, the function must
accept corresponding (mandatory) keyword arguments, and the values for
the keyword arguments must match the corresponding contracts. For
example:

@racketblock[(integer? #:x boolean? . -> . integer?)]

is a contract on a function that accepts a by-position argument that
is an integer and a @racket[#:x] argument that is a boolean.

If @racket[any] is used as the last sub-form for @racket[->], no
contract checking is performed on the result of the function, and
thus any number of values is legal (even different numbers on different
invocations of the function).

If @racket[(values range-expr ...)] is used as the last sub-form of
@racket[->], the function must produce a result for each contract, and
each value must match its respective contract.}

                 (code:line #:post/desc post-cond-expr)])]{

The @racket[->*] contract combinator produces contracts for functions
that accept optional arguments (either keyword or positional) and/or
arbitrarily many arguments. The first clause of a @racket[->*]
contract describes the mandatory arguments, and is similar to the
argument description of a @racket[->] contract. The second clause
describes the optional arguments. The range of description can either
be @racket[any] or a sequence of contracts, indicating that the
function must return multiple values.

If present, the
@racket[rest-expr] contract governs the arguments in the rest
parameter. Note that the @racket[rest-expr] contract governs only
the arguments in the rest parameter, not those in mandatory arguments.
For example, this contract:
@racketblock[(->* () #:rest (cons/c integer? (listof integer?)) any)]
does not match the function
@racketblock[(Î» (x . rest) x)]
because the contract insists that the function accept zero arguments
(because there are no mandatory arguments listed in the contract). The
@racket[->i] contract does not know that the contract on the rest argument is
going to end up disallowing empty argument lists.

The @racket[pre-cond-expr] and @racket[post-cond-expr]
expressions are checked as the function is called and returns,
respectively, and allow checking of the environment without an
explicit connection to an argument (or a result). If the @racket[#:pre]
or @racket[#:post] keywords are used, then a @racket[#f] result is
treated as a failure and any other result is treated as success.
If the @racket[#:pre/desc] or @racket[#:post/desc] keyword is used,
the result of the expression must be either a boolean, a string, or a
list of strings, where @racket[#t] means success and any of the other
results mean failure. If the result is a string or a list of strings,
the strings are expected to have at exactly one space after each
newline and multiple are used as lines in the error message; the contract
itself adds single space of indentation to each of the strings in that case.
The formatting requirements are not checked but they
match the recommendations in @secref["err-msg-conventions"].

As an example, the contract
@racketblock[(->* () (boolean? #:x integer?) #:rest (listof symbol?) symbol?)]
matches functions that optionally accept a boolean, an
integer keyword argument @racket[#:x] and arbitrarily more
symbols, and that return a symbol.

The @racket[->i] contract combinator differs from the @racket[->*]
combinator in that each argument and result is named and these names can
be used in the subcontracts and in the pre-/post-condition clauses.
In other words, @racket[->i] expresses dependencies among arguments and results.

The first sub-form of a @racket[->i] contract covers the mandatory and the
second sub-form covers the optional arguments. Following that is an optional
rest-args contract, and an optional pre-condition. The pre-condition is
introduced with the @racket[#:pre] keyword followed by the list of names on
which it depends. If the @racket[#:pre/name] keyword is used, the string
supplied is used as part of the error message; similarly with @racket[#:post/name].
If @racket[#:pre/desc] or @racket[#:post/desc] is used, the the result of
the expression is treated the same way as @racket[->*].

The @racket[dependent-range] non-terminal specifies the possible result
contracts. If it is @racket[any], then any value is allowed. Otherwise, the
result contract pairs a name and a contract or a multiple values return
with names and contracts. In the last two cases, the range contract may be
optionally followed by a post-condition; the post-condition expression is
not allowed if the range contract is @racket[any]. Like the pre-condition,
the post-condition must specify the variables on which it depends.

Consider this sample contract:
@racketblock[(->i ([x number?]
                   [y (x) (>=/c x)])
                  [result (x y) (and/c number? (>=/c (+ x y)))])]
It specifies a function of two arguments, both numbers. The contract on the
second argument (@racket[y]) demands that it is greater than the first
argument. The result contract promises a number that is greater than the
sum of the two arguments. While the dependency specification for @racket[y]
signals that the argument contract depends on the value of the first
argument, the dependency sequence for @racket[result] indicates that the
contract depends on both argument values. @margin-note*{In general, an
empty sequence is (nearly) equivalent to not adding
a sequence at all except that the former is more expensive than the latter.}
Since the contract for @racket[x] does not depend on anything else, it does
not come with any dependency sequence, not even @racket[()].

This example is like the previous one, except the @racket[x] and @racket[y]
arguments are now optional keyword arguments, instead of mandatory, by-position
arguments:
@racketblock[(->i ()
                  (#:x [x number?]
                   #:y [y (x) (>=/c x)])
                  [result (x y) (and/c number? (>=/c (+ x y)))])]

The contract expressions are not always evaluated in
order. First, if there is no dependency for a given contract expression,
the contract expression is evaluated at the time that the @racket[->i]
expression is evaluated rather than the time when the function is called or
returns.  These dependency-free contract expressions are evaluated in the
order in which they are listed.
@;
Second, the dependent contract sub-expressions are evaluated when the
contracted function is called or returns in some order that satisfies the
dependencies. That is, if a contract for an argument depends on the value
of some other contract, the former is evaluated first (so that the
argument, with its contract checked, is available for the other).  When
there is no dependency between two arguments (or the result and an
argument), then the contract that appears earlier in the source text is
evaluated first.

Finally, if all of the identifier positions of the range
contract are @racket[_]s (underscores), then the range contract expressions
are evaluated when the function is called and the underscore is not bound
in the range, after the argument contracts are evaluated and
checked. Otherwise, the range expressions are evaluated when the function
returns.

If there are optional arguments that are not supplied, then
the corresponding variables will be bound to a special value
called @racket[the-unsupplied-arg] value.

@defform[(unconstrained-domain-> range-expr ...)]{

Constructs a contract that accepts a function, but makes no constraint

ensure that the domain is actually known to be able to safely call the

For example, the contract

@racketblock[

says that the function @racket[f] accepts a natural number
and a function. The domain of the function that @racket[f]
accepts must include a case for @racket[size] arguments,
meaning that @racket[f] can safely supply @racket[size]
arguments to its input.

be blamed using the above contract:

@section[#:tag "parametric-contracts"]{Parametric Contracts}
@defmodule*/no-declare[(racket/contract/parametric)]
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/parametric]

The most convenient way to use parametric contract is to use
@racket[contract-out]'s @racket[#:exists] keyword.
The @racketmodname[racket/contract/parametric] provides a few more,
general-purpose parametric contracts.

@defform[(parametric->/c (x ...) c)]{

Creates a contract for parametric polymorphic functions.  Each function is
protected by @racket[c], where each @racket[x] is bound in @racket[c] and refers
to a polymorphic type that is instantiated each time the function is applied.

At each application of a function, the @racket[parametric->/c] contract constructs
a new opaque wrapper for each @racket[x]; values flowing into the polymorphic
function (i.e. values protected by some @racket[x] in negative position with
respect to @racket[parametric->/c]) are wrapped in the corresponding opaque
wrapper.  Values flowing out of the polymorphic function (i.e. values protected
by some @racket[x] in positive position with respect to @racket[parametric->/c])
are checked for the appropriate wrapper.  If they have it, they are unwrapped;
if they do not, a contract violation is signaled.

@examples[#:eval (contract-eval)
(define/contract (check x y)
  (parametric->/c [X] (boolean? X . -> . X))
  (if (or (not x) (equal? y 'surprise))
      'invalid
      y))
(check #t 'ok)
(check #f 'ignored)
(check #t 'surprise)
]
}

@defproc[(new-âˆ€/c [name (or/c symbol? #f) #f]) contract?]{
  Constructs a new universal contract.

  Universal contracts accept all values when in negative positions (e.g., function
  inputs) and wrap them in an opaque struct, hiding the precise value.
  In positive positions (e.g. function returns),
  a universal contract accepts only values that were previously accepted
  in negative positions (by checking for the wrappers).

  The name is used to identify the contract in error messages and defaults
  to a name based on the lexical context of @racket[new-âˆ€/c].

  For example, this contract:
  @racketblock[(let ([a (new-âˆ€/c 'a)])
                 (-> a a))]
  describes the identity function (or a non-terminating function).
  That is, the first use of the @racket[a] appears in a
  negative position and thus inputs to that function are wrapped with an opaque struct.
  Then, when the function returns, it is checked to determine whether the result is wrapped, since
  the second @racket[a] appears in a positive position.

  The @racket[new-âˆ€/c] construct constructor is dual to @racket[new-âˆƒ/c].
}

@defproc[(new-âˆƒ/c [name (or/c symbol? #f) #f]) contract?]{
  Constructs a new existential contract.

  Existential contracts accept all values when in positive positions (e.g., function
  returns) and wrap them in an opaque struct, hiding the precise value.
  In negative positions (e.g. function inputs),
  they accepts only values that were previously accepted in positive positions (by checking
  for the wrappers).

  The name is used to identify the contract in error messages and defaults
  to a name based on the lexical context of @racket[new-âˆ€/c].

  For example, this contract:
  @racketblock[(let ([a (new-âˆƒ/c 'a)])
                 (-> (-> a a)
                     any/c))]
  describes a function that accepts the identity function (or a non-terminating function)
  and returns an arbitrary value. That is, the first use of the @racket[a] appears in a
  positive position and thus inputs to that function are wrapped with an opaque struct.
  Then, when the function returns, it is checked to see if the result is wrapped, since
  the second @racket[a] appears in a negative position.

  The @racket[new-âˆƒ/c] construct constructor is dual to @racket[new-âˆ€/c].

Like @racket[struct], but with two differences:
they do not
define field mutators, and they define two contract constructors:
@racket[id]@racketidfont{/c} and @racket[id]@racketidfont{/dc}. The
first is a procedure that accepts as many arguments as there are
fields and returns a contract for struct values whose fields match the
arguments. The second is a syntactic form that also produces contracts
on the structs, but the contracts on later fields may depend on the
values of earlier fields.

The generated contract combinators are @italic{lazy}: they only verify
the contract holds for the portion of some data structure that is
actually inspected. More precisely, a lazy data structure contract is
not checked until a selector extracts a field of a struct.

contract on the field does not depend on the value of any other
field. The second case is for when the contract on the field does

earlier fields.}}

A @racket[_provide-spec] for use in @racket[provide] (currently only for
the same @tech{phase level} as the @racket[provide] form; for example,
@racket[contract-out] cannot be nested within @racket[for-syntax]). Each @racket[id]
is provided from the module. In
addition, clients of the module must live up to the contract specified
by @racket[contract-expr] for each export.

The @racket[contract-out] form treats modules as units of
blame. The module that defines the provided variable is expected to
meet the positive (co-variant) positions of the contract. Each module
that imports the provided variable must obey the negative
(contra-variant) positions of the contract. Each @racket[contract-expr]
in a @racket[contract-out] form is effectively moved to the end of the
enclosing module, so a @racket[contract-expr] can refer to variables
that are defined later in the same module.

Only uses of the contracted variable outside the module are
checked. Inside the module, no contract checking occurs.

The @racket[rename] form of @racket[contract-out] exports the
first variable (the internal name) with the name specified by the
second variable (the external name).

The @racket[struct] form of @racket[contract-out]
provides a structure-type definition, and each field has a contract
that dictates the contents of the fields. The structure-type
definition must appear before the @racket[provide] clause within the
enclosing module. If the structure type has a parent, the second
@racket[struct] form (above) must be used, with the first name
referring to the structure type to export and the second name
referring to the parent structure type. Unlike a @racket[struct]
definition, however, all of the fields (and their contracts) must be
listed. The contract on the fields that the sub-struct shares with its
parent are only used in the contract for the sub-struct's constructor, and
the selector or mutators for the super-struct are not provided. The
exported structure-type name always doubles as a constructor, even if
the original structure-type name does not act as a constructor.
If the @racket[#:omit-constructor] option is present, the constructor
is not provided.

The @racket[#:âˆƒ], @racket[#:exists], @racket[#:âˆ€], and @racket[#:forall]
clauses define new abstract contracts. The variables are bound in the
remainder of the @racket[contract-out] form to new contracts that hide
the values they accept and ensure that the exported functions are treated
parametrically. See @racket[new-âˆƒ/c] and @racket[new-âˆ€/c] for details
on how the clauses hide the values.

The implementation of @racket[contract-out] uses
@racket[syntax-property] to attach properties to the code it generates
that records the syntax of the contracts in the fully expanded program.
Specifically, the symbol @racket['provide/contract-original-contract]
is bound to vectors of two elements, the exported identifier and a
syntax object for the expression that produces the contract controlling
the export.
}

@defform[(recontract-out id ...)]{
   A @racket[_provide-spec] for use in @racket[provide] (currently,
     just like @racket[contract-out], only for
     the same @tech{phase level} as the @racket[provide] form).
     
   It re-exports @racket[id], but with positive blame associated
   to the module containing @racket[recontract-out] instead of the
   location of the original site of @racket[id].
   
   This can be useful when a public module wants to export an
   identifier from a private module but where any contract violations
   should be reported in terms of the public module instead of the
   private one.
   
   @examples[#:eval

   Replacing the use of @racket[contract-out] with just
   @racket[recip] would result in a contract violation blaming
   the private module.

The @racket[define/contract] form treats the individual definition as
a contract region. The definition itself is responsible for positive

   @italic{The precise details of the 
           @racket[val-first-projection] argument
           are subject to change. (Probably
           also the default values of the @racket[project] 
           arguments will change.}
   
These functions build simple higher-order contracts, chaperone contracts, and flat contracts,
respectively.  They both take the same set of three optional arguments: a name,
a first-order predicate, and a blame-tracking projection.

The @racket[name] argument is any value to be rendered using @racket[display] to
describe the contract when a violation occurs.  The default name for simple
higher-order contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-contract], for chaperone
contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-chaperone-contract], and for flat
contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-flat-contract].

The first-order predicate @racket[test] can be used to determine which values
the contract applies to; usually, this is the set of values for which the
contract fails immediately without any higher-order wrapping.  This test is used
by @racket[contract-first-order-passes?], and indirectly by @racket[or/c] to
determine which of multiple higher-order contracts to wrap a value with.  The
default test accepts any value.

The projection @racket[proj] defines the behavior of applying the contract.  It
is a curried function of two arguments: the first application accepts a blame
object, and the second accepts a value to protect with the contract.  The
projection must either produce the value, suitably wrapped to enforce any
higher-order aspects of the contract, or signal a contract violation using
@racket[raise-blame-error].  The default projection produces an error when the
first-order test fails, and produces the value unchanged otherwise.

Projections for chaperone contracts must produce a value that passes
@racket[chaperone-of?] when compared with the original, uncontracted value.
Projections for flat contracts must fail precisely when the first-order test
does, and must produce the input value unchanged otherwise.  Applying a flat
contract may result in either an application of the predicate, or the
projection, or both; therefore, the two must be consistent.  The existence of a
separate projection only serves to provide more specific error messages.  Most
flat contracts do not need to supply an explicit projection.

The @racket[stronger] argument is used to implement @racket[contract-stronger?]. The
first argument is always the contract itself and the second argument is whatever
was passed as the second argument to @racket[contract-stronger?].

The @racket[is-list-contract?] argument is used by the @racket[list-contract?] predicate
to determine if this is a contract that accepts only @racket[list?] values.

         blame?]{
  Adds some context information to blame error messages
  that explicates which portion of the contract failed
  (and that gets rendered by @racket[raise-blame-error]).

  The @racket[context] argument describes one layer of the
  portion of the contract, typically of the form @racket["the 1st argument of"]
  (in the case of a function contract)
  or @racket["a conjunct of"] (in the case of an @racket[and/c] contract).

  For example, consider this contract violation:
  @interaction[#:eval (contract-eval)
(define/contract f
  (list/c (-> integer? integer?))
  (list (Î» (x) x)))

((car f) #f)
]
It shows that the portion of the contract being violated is the first
occurrence of @racket[integer?], because the @racket[->] and
the @racket[list/c] combinators each internally called
@racket[blame-add-context] to add the two lines following
``in'' in the error message.

The @racket[important] argument is used to build the beginning part
of the contract violation. The last @racket[important] argument that
gets added to a @|blame-object| is used. The @racket[class/c] contract
adds an important argument, as does the @racket[->] contract (when
@racket[->] knows the name of the function getting the contract).

The @racket[swap?] argument has the effect of calling @racket[blame-swap]
while adding the layer of context, but without creating an extra
@|blame-object|.

The context information recorded in blame structs keeps track of
combinators that do not add information, and add the string @racket["..."]
for them, so programmers at least see that there was some context
they are missing in the error messages. Accordingly, since there are
combinators that should not add any context (e.g., @racket[recursive-contract]),
passing @racket[#f] as the context string argument avoids adding the
@racket["..."] string.

The remaining arguments are a format string,
@racket[fmt], and its arguments, @racket[v ...], specifying an error message
specific to the precise violation.

If @racket[fmt] is a list, then the elements are concatenated together

after first replacing symbols with either their string counterparts, or
replacing @racket['given] with @racket["produced"] and
@racket['expected] with @racket["promised"], depending on whether or not
the @racket[b] argument has been swapped or not (see @racket[blame-swap]).

If @racket[fmt] contains the symbols @racket['given:] or @racket['expected:],

These functions build the arguments for @racket[prop:contract],
@racket[prop:chaperone-contract], and @racket[prop:flat-contract], respectively.

A @deftech{contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure when used as
a contract.  It is specified in terms of five accessors: @racket[get-name],
which produces a description to @racket[write] as part of a contract violation;
@racket[get-first-order], which produces a first-order predicate to be used by
@racket[contract-first-order-passes?]; @racket[get-projection], which
produces a blame-tracking projection defining the behavior of the contract;
@racket[stronger], which is a predicate that determines whether this contract
(passed in the first argument) is stronger than some other contract (passed
in the second argument); @racket[generate], which returns a thunk
that generates random values matching the contract (using @racket[contract-random-generate-fail])
to indicate failure) or @racket[#f] to indicate
that random generation for this contract isn't supported; @racket[exercise],
which returns a function that exercises values matching the contract (e.g.,
if it is a function contract, it may call the function) and a list of contracts
whose values will be generated by this process; and @racket[is-flat-contract?],
which is used by @racket[flat-contract?] to determine if this contract
accepts only @racket[list?]s.

These accessors are passed as (optional) keyword arguments to
@racket[build-contract-property], and are applied to instances of the
appropriate structure type by the contract system.  Their results are used
analogously to the arguments of @racket[make-contract].

A @deftech{chaperone contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure
when used as a chaperone contract.  It is specified using
@racket[build-chaperone-contract-property], and accepts exactly the same set of
arguments as @racket[build-contract-property].  The only difference is that the
projection accessor must return a value that passes @racket[chaperone-of?] when
compared with the original, uncontracted value.

A @deftech{flat contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure when
used as a flat contract.  It is specified using
@racket[build-flat-contract-property], and accepts exactly the same set of
arguments as @racket[build-contract-property].  The only difference is that the
projection accessor is expected not to wrap its argument in a higher-order
fashion, analogous to the constraint on projections in
@racket[make-flat-contract].

@subsection{Obligation Information in Check Syntax}

@seclink[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/drracket/drracket.scrbl")
"buttons" #:indirect? #t]{Check Syntax} in DrRacket shows obligation information for
contracts according to @racket[syntax-property]s that the contract combinators
leave in the expanded form of the program. These properties indicate
where contracts appear in the source and where the positive and negative
positions of the contracts appear.

To make Check Syntax show obligation information for your new contract
combinators, use the following properties (some helper macros and functions
are below):

@itemize[@item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:contract :
                             (vector/c symbol? (listof syntax?) (listof syntax?))]
                This property should be attached to the result of a transformer
                that implements a contract combinator. It signals to Check Syntax
                that this is where a contract begins.

                The first element in the
                vector should be a unique (in the sense of @racket[eq?]) value
                that Check Syntax can use a tag to match up this contract with
                its subpieces (specified by the two following syntax properties).

                The second and third elements of the vector are syntax objects
                from pieces of the contract, and Check Syntax will color them.
                The first list should contain subparts that are the responsibility
                of parties (typically modules) that provide implementations of the contract.
                The second list should contain subparts that are the
                responsibility of clients.

                For example, in @racket[(->* () #:pre #t any/c #:post #t)],
                the @racket[->*] and the @racket[#:post] should be in the first
                list and @racket[#:pre] in the second list.}

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:negative-position : symbol?]
                 This property should be attached to sub-expressions of
                 a contract combinator that are expected to be other contracts.
                 The value of the property should be the key (the first element from
                 the vector for the @racket['racket/contract:contract] property)
                 indicating which contract this is.

                 This property should be used when the expression's value is a contract
                 that clients are responsible for. }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:positive-position : symbol?]
                 This form is just like @racket['racket/contract:negative-position],
                 except that it should be used when the expression's value is
                 a contract that the original party should be responsible for.
                 }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:contract-on-boundary : symbol?]
                 The presence of this property tells Check Syntax that it
                 should start coloring from this point. It expects the expression
                 to be a contract
                 (and, thus, to have the @racket['racket/contract:contract] property);
                 this property indicates that this contract is on a (module) boundary.

                 (The value of the property is not used.)
                 }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:internal-contract : symbol?]

                 Like @racket['racket/contract:contract-on-boundary], the presence
                 of this property triggers coloring, but this is meant for use
                 when the party (module) containing the contract (regardless of whether
                 or not this module exports anything matching the contract)
                 can be blamed for violating the contract. This comes into play
                 for @racket[->i] contracts, since the contract itself has
                 access to values under contract via the dependency.

Delays the evaluation of its argument until the contract is checked,
making recursive contracts possible.  If @racket[type] is given, it
describes the expected type of contract and must be one of the keywords
@racket[#:impersonator], @racket[#:chaperone], or @racket[#:flat].  If
@racket[type] is not given, an impersonator contract is created.

If @racket[#:list-contract?] is returned, then the result is a
@racket[list-contract?] and the @racket[contract-expr] must evaluate
to a @racket[list-contract?].

This optimizes its argument contract expression by
traversing its syntax and, for known contract combinators,
fuses them into a single contract combinator that avoids as
much allocation overhead as possible. The result is a
contract that should behave identically to its argument,
except faster.

If the @racket[#:error-name] argument is present, and
@racket[contract-expr] evaluates to a non-contract
expression, then @racket[opt/c] raises an error using
@racket[id] as the name of the primitive, instead of using
the name @racket[opt/c].

@defform[(define-opt/c (id id ...) expr)]{

This defines a recursive contract and simultaneously
optimizes it. Semantically, it behaves just as if
the @racket[-opt/c] were not present, defining a function on
contracts (except that the body expression must return a
contract). But, it also optimizes that contract definition,
avoiding extra allocation, much like @racket[opt/c] does.

For example,

@racketblock[
(define-contract-struct bt (val left right))

(define-opt/c (bst-between/c lo hi)
  (or/c null?
        (bt/c [val (real-in lo hi)]
              [left (val) (bst-between/c lo val)]
              [right (val) (bst-between/c val hi)])))

(define bst/c (bst-between/c -inf.0 +inf.0))
]

defines the @racket[bst/c] contract that checks the binary
search tree invariant. Removing the @racket[-opt/c] also
makes a binary search tree contract, but one that is
(approximately) 20 times slower.}

@section{@racketmodname[racket/contract/base]}

@defmodule[racket/contract/base]

The @racketmodname[racket/contract/base] module provides a subset
of the exports of @racketmodname[racket/contract] module. In
particular, it contains everything in the
@itemize[@item{@secref["data-structure-contracts"]}
         @item{@secref["function-contracts"]}
         @item{@secref["attaching-contracts-to-values"] and}
         @item{@secref["contract-utilities"] sections.}]

Unfortunately, using @racketmodname[racket/contract/base] does not
yield a significantly smaller memory footprint than
@racketmodname[racket/contract], but it can still be useful to
add contracts to libraries that @racketmodname[racket/contract]
uses to implement some of the more sophisticated
parts of the contract system.

Attempts to randomly generate a value which will match the contract. The fuel
argument limits how hard the generator tries to generate a value matching the
contract and is a rough limit of the size of the resulting value.

The generator may fail to generate a value, either because some contracts
do not have corresponding generators (for example, not all predicates have
generators) or because there is not enough fuel. In either case, the
function @racket[fail] is invoked. If @racket[fail] accepts an argument,
it is called with @racket[#t] when there is no generator for @racket[ctc]
and called with @racket[#f] when there is a generator, but the generator
ended up returning @racket[contract-random-generate-fail].
