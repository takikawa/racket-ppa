@title[#:tag "intro"]{Welcome to Racket}

Depending on how you look at it, @bold{Racket} is

@itemize[

 @item{a @defterm{programming language}---a dialect of Lisp and a
       descendant of Scheme;

       @margin-note{See @secref["dialects"] for more information on
       other dialects of Lisp and how they relate to Racket.}}

 @item{a @defterm{family} of programming languages---variants of
       Racket, and more; or}

 @item{a set of @defterm{tools}---for using a family of programming languages.}
]

Where there is no room for confusion, we use simply @defterm{Racket}.

Racket's main tools are

@itemize[

 @tool[@exec{racket}]{the core compiler, interpreter, and run-time system;}

 @tool["DrRacket"]{the programming environment; and}

 @tool[@exec{raco}]{a command-line tool for executing @bold{Ra}cket
 @bold{co}mmands that install packages, build libraries, and more.}

]

Most likely, you'll want to explore the Racket language using
DrRacket, especially at the beginning. If you prefer, you can also
work with the command-line @exec{racket} interpreter and your favorite
text editor; see also @secref["other-editors"]. The rest of this guide
presents the language mostly independent of your choice of editor.

If you're using DrRacket, you'll need to choose the proper language,
because DrRacket accommodates many different variants of Racket, as
well as other languages. Assuming that you've never used DrRacket
before, start it up, type the line

@racketmod[racket]

in DrRacket's top text area, and then click the @onscreen{Run} button
that's above the text area. DrRacket then understands that you mean to
work in the normal variant of Racket (as opposed to the smaller
@racketmodname[racket/base] or many other possibilities).

@margin-note{@secref["more-hash-lang"] describes some of the other
             possibilities.}

If you've used DrRacket before with something other than a program
that starts @hash-lang[], DrRacket will remember the last language
that you used, instead of inferring the language from the @hash-lang[]
line. In that case, use the @menuitem["Language" "Choose Language..."]
menu item.  In the dialog that appears, select the first item, which
tells DrRacket to use the language that is declared in a source
program via @hash-lang[]. Put the @hash-lang[] line above in the top
text area, still.

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Interacting with Racket}

DrRacket's bottom text area and the @exec{racket} command-line program
(when started with no options) both act as a kind of calculator. You
type a Racket expression, hit the Return key, and the answer is
printed. In the terminology of Racket, this kind of calculator is
called a @idefterm{read-eval-print loop} or @deftech{REPL}.

A number by itself is an expression, and the answer is just the
number:

@interaction[5]

A string is also an expression that evaluates to itself. A string is
written with double quotes at the start and end of the string:

@interaction["Hello, world!"]

Racket uses parentheses to wrap larger expressions---almost any kind
of expression, other than simple constants. For example, a function
call is written: open parenthesis, function name, argument
expression, and closing parenthesis. The following expression calls
the built-in function @racket[substring] with the arguments
@racket["the boy out of the country"], @racket[4], and @racket[7]:

@interaction[(substring "the boy out of the country" 4 7)]

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Definitions and Interactions}

You can define your own functions that work like @racket[substring] by
using the @racket[define] form, like this:

@def+int[
#:eval piece-eval
(define (extract str)
  (substring str 4 7))
(extract "the boy out of the country")
(extract "the country out of the boy")
]

Although you can evaluate the @racket[define] form in the @tech{REPL},
definitions are normally a part of a program that you want to keep and
use later. So, in DrRacket, you'd normally put the definition in the
top text area---called the @deftech{definitions area}---along with the
@hash-lang[] prefix:

@racketmod[
racket
code:blank
(define (extract str)
  (substring str 4 7))
]

If calling @racket[(extract "the boy")] is part of the main action of
your program, that would go in the @tech{definitions area}, too. But
if it was just an example expression that you were using to explore
@racket[extract], then you'd more likely leave the @tech{definitions
area} as above, click @onscreen{Run}, and then evaluate
@racket[(extract "the boy")] in the @tech{REPL}.

When using command-line @exec{racket} instead of DrRacket, you'd save
the above text in a file using your favorite editor. If you save it as
@filepath{extract.rkt}, then after starting @exec{racket} in the same
directory, you'd evaluate the following sequence:

@margin-note{If you use @racketmodname[xrepl], you can use
  @(link-element "plainlink" (litchar ",enter extract.rkt") `(xrepl "enter")).}

@interaction[
#:eval piece-eval
(eval:alts (enter! "extract.rkt") (void))
(extract "the gal out of the city")
]

The @racket[enter!] form both loads the code and switches the
evaluation context to the inside of the module, just like DrRacket's
@onscreen{Run} button.

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Creating Executables}

If your file (or @tech{definitions area} in DrRacket) contains

@racketmod[
racket

(define (extract str)
  (substring str 4 7))

(extract "the cat out of the bag")
]

then it is a complete program that prints ``cat'' when run. You can
run the program within DrRacket or using @racket[enter!] in
@exec{racket}, but if the program is saved in @nonterm{src-filename},
you can also run it from a command line with

@commandline{racket @nonterm{src-filename}}

To package the program as an executable, you have a few options:

@itemize[

 @item{In DrRacket, you can select the @menuitem["Racket" "Create
       Executable..."] menu item.}

 @item{From a command-line prompt, run @exec{raco exe
       @nonterm{src-filename}}, where @nonterm{src-filename} contains
       the program. See @secref[#:doc '(lib
       "scribblings/raco/raco.scrbl") "exe"] for more information.}

 @item{With Unix or Mac OS X, you can turn the program file into an
       executable script by inserting the line

       @margin-note{See @secref["scripts"] for more information on
                    script files.}

        @verbatim[#:indent 2]{#! /usr/bin/env racket}

       at the very beginning of the file. Also, change the file
       permissions to executable using @exec{chmod +x
       @nonterm{filename}} on the command line.

       The script works as long as @exec{racket} is in the user's
       executable search path.  Alternately, use a full path to
       @exec{racket} after @tt{#!}  (with a space between @tt{#!}
       and the path), in which case the user's executable search path
       does not matter.}

]

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
@section[#:tag "use-module"]{A Note to Readers with Lisp/Scheme Experience}

If you already know something about Racket or Lisp, you might be
tempted to put just

@racketblock[
(define (extract str)
  (substring str 4 7))
]

into @filepath{extract.rktl} and run @exec{racket} with

@interaction[
#:eval piece-eval
(eval:alts (load "extract.rktl") (void))
(extract "the dog out")
]

That will work, because @exec{racket} is willing to imitate a
traditional Lisp environment, but we strongly recommend against using
@racket[load] or writing programs outside of a module.

Writing definitions outside of a module leads to bad error messages,
bad performance, and awkward scripting to combine and run
programs. The problems are not specific to @exec{racket}; they're
fundamental limitations of the traditional top-level environment,
which Scheme and Lisp implementations have historically fought with ad
hoc command-line flags, compiler directives, and build tools. The
module system is designed to avoid these problems, so start with
@hash-lang[], and you'll be happier with Racket in the long run.
