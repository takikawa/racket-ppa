@title{@bold{The Racket Guide}}

@author["Matthew Flatt" "Robert Bruce Findler" "PLT"]

This guide is intended for programmers who are new to Racket or new to
some part of Racket. It assumes programming experience, so if you are
new to programming, consider instead reading @|HtDP|. If you want an
especially quick introduction to Racket, start with @|Quick|.

@seclink["to-scheme"]{Chapter 2} provides a brief introduction to
Racket. From @seclink["datatypes"]{Chapter 3} on, this guide dives
into details---covering much of the Racket toolbox, but leaving
precise details to @|Racket| and other reference manuals.

@margin-note{The source of this manual is available on
@hyperlink["https://github.com/racket/racket/tree/master/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/guide"]{GitHub}.}
