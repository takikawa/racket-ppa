@title{@exec{raco}: Racket Command-Line Tools}

The @exec{raco} program supports various Racket tasks from a command
line. The first argument to @exec{raco} is always a specific command
name. For example, @exec{raco make} starts a command to compile a
Racket source module to bytecode format.

The set of commands available through @exec{raco} is extensible. Use
@exec{raco help} to get a complete list of available commands for your
installation. This manual covers the commands that are available in
a typical Racket installation.
