@title[#:tag "launcher"]{Installation-Specific Launchers}

A @deftech{launcher} is similar to a stand-alone executable, but a
launcher is usually smaller and can be created more quickly, because
it depends permanently on the local Racket installation and the
program's sources. In the case of Unix, a launcher is simply a shell
script that runs @exec{racket} or @exec{gracket}. Launchers
@emph{cannot} be packaged into a distribution using @exec{raco
distribute}. The @exec{raco exe} command creates a launcher when the
@Flag{l} or @DFlag{launcher} flag is specified.

@defmodule[launcher/launcher]

The @racketmodname[launcher/launcher] library provides functions for
creating @tech{launchers}.

@section{Creating Launchers}

@defproc[(make-gracket-launcher [args (listof string?)]
                                [dest path-string?]
                                [aux (listof (cons/c symbol? any/c)) null]
                                [#:tether-mode tether-mode (or/c 'addon 'config #f) 'addon])
         void?]{

Creates the launcher @racket[dest], which starts GRacket with the
command-line arguments specified as strings in @racket[args]. Extra
arguments passed to the launcher at run-time are appended (modulo
special Unix/X flag handling, as described below) to this list and
passed on to GRacket. If @racket[dest] exists already, as either a file
or directory, it is replaced.

The optional @racket[aux] argument is an association list for
platform-specific options (i.e., it is a list of pairs where the first
element of the pair is a key symbol and the second element is the
value for that key). See also @racket[build-aux-from-path]. See
@racket[create-embedding-executable] for a list that applies to both
stand-alone executables and launchers on Windows and Mac OS GRacket;
the following additional associations apply to launchers:

@itemize[

 @item{@racket['independent?] (Windows) --- a boolean; @racket[#t]
       creates an old-style launcher that works with any
       Racket or GRacket binary, like @exec{raco.exe}. No other
       @racket[aux] associations are used for an old-style launcher.}

 @item{@racket['exe-name] (Mac OS, @racket['script-3m] or
       @racket['script-cgc] variant) --- provides the base name for a
       @racket['3m]-/@racket['cgc]-variant launcher, which the script
       will call ignoring @racket[args]. If this name is not provided,
       the script will go through the GRacket executable as usual.}

 @item{@racket['exe-is-gracket] (when @racket['exe-name] is used) ---
       indicates that @racket['exe-name] refers to the GRacket
       executable, which is potentially in a @filepath{lib}
       subdirectory instead of with other GUI applications.}

 @item{@racket['relative?] (all platforms) --- a boolean, where
        @racket[#t] means that the generated launcher should find the
        base GRacket executable through a relative path.}

 @item{@racket['install-mode] (Windows, Unix) --- either
       @racket['main], @racket['user], @racket['config-tethered], or
       @racket['addon-tethered], indicates that the launcher
       is being installed to an
       installation-wide place, a user-specific place, an installation-wide
       place that embeds the configuration path, or a specific place that
       embeds an addon-directory path;
       the install mode, in turn, determines whether and where to
       record @racket['start-menu], @racket['extension-registry],
       and/or @racket['desktop] information.}

 @item{@racket['start-menu] (Windows) --- a boolean or real number;
       @racket[#t] indicates that the launcher should be in the
       @onscreen{Start} menu by an installer that includes the
       launcher. A number value is treated like @racket[#t], but also
       requests that the installer automatically start the
       application, where the number determines a precedence relative
       to other launchers that may request starting.  A
       @racket['start-menu] value is used only when
       @racket['install-mode] is also specified.}

 @item{@racket['extension-register] (Windows) --- a list of document
       types for file-extension registrations to be performed by an
       installer. Each document type is described by a list of six
       items:

         @itemlist[

            @item{a human-readable string describing the document
                  type, such as @racket["Racket Document"];}

            @item{a string to use as a key for the document type,
                  such as @racket["Racket.Document"];}

            @item{a list of strings, where each string is a file
                  extension without the dot, such as @racket['("rkt"
                  "rktl" "rktd")];}

            @item{a path to a file that supplies the icon, such as
                  @racket["doc.ico"];}

            @item{a string to represent the command line to handle a
                  document with a matching extension, such as
                  @racket["\"%1\""], where the string will be prefixed
                  with a path to the launcher, and where @litchar{%1}
                  will be replaced with the document path}
          ]

       An @racket['extension-registry] value is used only when
       @racket['install-mode] is also specified.}

 @item{@racket['desktop] (Unix) --- a string containing the content of
       a @filepath{.desktop} file for the launcher, where @tt{Exec}
       and @tt{Icon} entries are added automatically. If an @tt{Exec}
       entry exists in the string, and if its value starts with a
       non-empty sequence of alpha-numeric ASCII characters followed
       by a space, then the space and remainder of the value is
       appended to the automatically generated value.
       The @filepath{.desktop} file is written to the directory produced by
       @racket[(find-apps-dir)] or @racket[(find-user-apps-dir)]. A
       @racket['desktop] value is used only when
       @racket['install-mode] is also specified.}

  @item{@racket['png] (Unix) : An icon file path (suffix
        @filepath{.png}) to be referenced by a @filepath{.desktop}
        file (if any); a @racket['png] value takes precedence over a
        @racket['ico] value, but neither is used unless a
        @racket['desktop] value is also present.}

  @item{@racket['ico] (Unix, in addition to more general Windows use)
        : An icon file path (suffix @filepath{.ico}) that is used in
        the same way as @racket['png] if no @racket['png] value is
        available.}

]

For Unix/X, the script created by @racket[make-mred-launcher] detects
and handles X Windows flags specially when they appear as the initial
arguments to the script. Instead of appending these arguments to the
end of @racket[args], they are spliced in after any X Windows flags
already listed in @racket[args]. The remaining arguments (i.e.,
all script flags and arguments after the last X Windows flag or
argument) are then appended after the spliced @racket[args].

The @racket[tether-mode] argument indicates how much to preserve the
current installation's tethering to a configuration directory and/or
addon directory based on @racket[(find-addon-tether-console-bin-dir)]
and @racket[(find-config-tether-console-bin-dir)]. The @racket['addon]
mode allows full tethering, the @racket['config] mode allows only
configuration-directory tethering, and the @racket[#f] mode disables
tethering.

launcher creation and for generating launcher names. The default is
the result of @racket[(system-type 'gc)]. On Unix and Windows, the
possibilities are @racket['cgc] and @racket['3m]. On Mac OS, the
@racket['script-3m] and @racket['script-cgc] variants are also
available for GRacket launchers.}

@defproc[(available-gracket-variants) (listof symbol?)]{

Returns a list of symbols corresponding to available variants of GRacket

least one of @racket['3m] or @racket['cgc]--- whichever is the result
of @racket[(system-type 'gc)]---and may include the other, as well as
@racket['script-3m] and/or @racket['script-cgc] on Mac OS.}

@defproc[(available-racket-variants) (listof symbol?)]{
