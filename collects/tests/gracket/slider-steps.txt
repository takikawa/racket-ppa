The slider's initial value should be 3. The range is -1 to 11.

Change the slider value in each way allowed by the control (dragging,
 clicking in page-up/page-down, clicking on one-step arrows). For
 each change, the console should contain "Callback Ok". When you
 drag, one callback may be reported for the whole drag, or
 intermediate callbacks may be reported.

Click "Up" until the slider is at the top; a mismatch exception should
 be reported. Click "Down" once and verify that the slider is at 10.

Repeat the above step for "Down" (checking for an exception when the
 slider is already at its minimum value).

Repeat the above two steps for "Simulate Up" and "Simulate Down". For
 the simulates, the console should report "Callback Ok" for each click.
 If you try to go too far up or down, the console should report an
 error: "slider value mismatch".

Click the "Check" button. The console should report "All Ok".
