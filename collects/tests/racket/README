To run most of the tests, run:
 > (load "PATHTOHERE/all.ss")
where PATHTOHERE is the path to this directory.  

Test failures may cause the test to stop before finishing, but most
test failures will let the test continue, and a summary message at the
end will enummerate the failures that occurred.

Some files and directories are created (in the current directory)
during the run. The files are named "tmp<N>" where <N> is a number.
The directory is named "deep". If the test suite passes, the directory
should be removed, but some "tmp<N>" files will remain. (The "tmp<N>"
files are automatically replaced if the test suite is run again.)

Additionally, test `expand' by running:
 > (load "PATHTOHERE/expand.ss")

Test compilation and writing/reading compiled code with:
 > (load "PATHTOHERE/compile.ss")

Run the standard tests with no output except for the results with:
 > (load "PATHTOHERE/quiet.ss")
(Also get an error code -- use with scripts.)

Run 3 copies of the test suite concurrently in separate threads:
 > (load "PATHTOHERE/parallel.ss")
