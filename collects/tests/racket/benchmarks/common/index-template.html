<H1>About the Benchmarks</H1>

<p>The <a href="Benchmarks.html">benchmark results page</a> shows some
   benchmark results on a collection of fairly standard (mostly
   Gabriel) Scheme benchmarks.</p>

<p>Tables show relative performance, with the actual time for the
   fastest run shown on the left. So, by
   default, <font color=forestgreen><b>1</b></font> is the fastest,
   but select any implementation to normalize the table with respect
   to that implementation&rsquo;s speed. A <tt>-</tt> appears when a
   benchmark didn&rsquo;t run in an implementation for some reason (possibly
   not a good one).</p>

<p><font color="gray" size="-1">
The <a href="../log2/Benchmarks.html">compilers-only page</a> shows
just the compilers among the tested implementations. For those
results, the small gray numbers are (relative) compile times, where
the compile time for the <tt>nothing</tt> benchmark is subtracted from
every other benchmark&rsquo;s compile time.</font></p>

<p>Run times are averaged over three runs for compilers or one run for
   interpreters. All reported times are CPU time (system plus user).
   The times are based on the output of the
   implementation&rsquo;s <tt>time</tt> syntactic form or similar
   functions.</p>

<p>Machine:
<ul>
  <li> MacBook Pro, 2.53 GHz, Mac OS X 10.6.2, compiling to 32-bit programs
</ul></p>

<p>Compiler configurations:
<ul>
<li> Bigloo (3.3a): <tt>-06 -call/cc -copt -O3 -copt -fomit-frame-pointer</tt></li>
<li> Chicken (4.3.0): <tt>-no-trace -no-lambda-info -optimize-level 3 -block -lambda-lift</tt></li>
<li> Gambit (4.6.0): <tt>(declare (block) (standard-bindings) (extended-bindings) (safe) (interrupts-enabled))</tt>, 
     compiled and run with <tt>-:m10000</tt></li>
<li> Guile (1.9.7): <tt>load</tt></li>
<li> Ikarus (0.0.4-rc1+ rev 1870): in R6RS library</li>
<li> Larceny (0.97): in R6RS library</li>
<li> MIT (7.7.90+): <tt>(declare (usual-integrations))</tt>; run with <tt>--heap 12000</tt></li>
<li> Petite Chez (7.4d): <tt>load</tt>
<li> PLT (4.2.4): in <tt>module</tt>; for benchmarks that use <tt>set-car!</tt> and <tt>set-cdr!</tt>, 
     PLT&rsquo;s R5RS support is used</li>
<li> Scheme48 (1.8): <tt>load</tt> after <tt>,bench on</tt></li>
</ul>
These configurations are all &ldquo;safe mode,&rdquo; but they allow a
compiler to assume that built-in Scheme functions are not redefined
and that no top-level defintion is ever changed. Such assumptions
correspond to putting the benchmark in an R6RS library.  We attempt to
use the various implementations in a compentent way, but not in a
sophisticated way. For example, we do not tweak inlining parameters or
specify fixnum arithmetic (where appropriate), which could produce
significant improvements from some compilers.</p>

<p>For more benchmarks and a more sophisticated use of a few compilers,
   including fixnum- and flonum-specific arithmetic as well as unsafe modes,
   see <a href="../log1/Gambit_20benchmarks.html">Gambit benchmark results</a>.</p>

   infrastructure, which is available form the PLT git repository:</p>
