;; tic-func.rkt
;; This program plays through all possibilities of a tic-tac-toe
;; game, given the first move of a player. It only prints how many
;; states are being processed and how many states are terminal at
;; each stage of the game. But it is constructed so that it can
;; print how to get to a winning terminal state. 

;; It relies on list-library.rkt.
