<H1>About the Benchmarks</H1>

<p>The pages linked below show some benchmark results on a collection of fairly standard
   (mostly Gabriel) Scheme benchmarks.</p>

<p>Tables show relative performance, with the actual time for the fastest
   run shown on the left. So, by default, <font color=forestgreen><b>1</b></font> 
   is the fastest, but select any implementation to normalize the table with
   respect to that implementation's speed. A <tt>--</tt> appears when a benchmark
   didn't run in an implementation (and you should assume a benchmark problem,
   rather than an implementation problem).</p>

<p><font color="gray" size="-1">Small gray numbers are (relative) compile times.</font></p>

<p>Run times are averaged over three runs. All reported times are CPU time (system plus user).
   Where available, the times are based on the output of the implementation's <tt>time</tt> 
   syntactic form, otherwise <tt>/usr/bin/time</tt> is used.</p>

<p>Compiler configuration:
<ul>
<li> Bigloo (2.8b): <tt>-06 -copt -O3 -copt -fomit-frame-pointer</tt></il>
<li> Chicken (2 build 3): <tt>-no-trace -no-lambda-info -optimize-level 3 -block -lambda-lift</tt></il>
<li> Gambit (4.0 beta 17): <tt>(declare (block) (standard-bindings) (extended-bindings) (safe) (interrupts-enabled))</tt>, 
     installed with <tt>--enable-single-host</tt>, compiled with <tt>-dynamic</tt>, compiled and run with <tt>-:m10000</tt></li>
<li> Larceny (0.92b): default mode &mdash; but should use <tt>(benchmark-block-mode #t)</tt> when it works</li>
<li> MzScheme (352.5): in <tt>module</tt></li>
</ul>
These configurations are all "safe mode", but they allow the compiler
to assume that built-in Scheme functions are not redefined and (except
in the case of Larceny) that no top-level defintion is ever
changed. Such assumptions correspond to putting the benchmark in an
R6RS library (we expect).</P>

<p>In general, we attempt to use the various implementations in a compentent way,
   but not in a sophisticated way. For example, we do not tweak
   inlining parameters or specify fixnum arithmetic (where appropriate),
   which could produce significant improvements from some compilers.</p>

<p>For a larger set of benchmarks and a more sophisticated use of the compilers,
   see Marc Feeley's page:
