MysterX test control
====================

The file mystests.ss in this directory creates a window
with a test ActiveX control, and runs a number of tests on it.
After the internal tests are performed, you can interact 
with the test control using a mouse.

The C++ code in the src subdirectory is supplied uncompiled.
You need Visual C++ .NET to compile it.

To compile, run "nmake".  Once you've compiled the test ActiveX 
control, load "mystests.ss".

DHTML test code
===============

The file dhtmltests.ss contains a number of tests
for the Dynamic HTML capabilities of MysterX.
Simply load the file into Racket or DrRacket to run the 
tests.  Any errors will be printed in the REPL.
The behavior that appears in the window that is created
may be ignored.

Manual tests
============

Here are some manual tests to run on MysterX:

  - run mxdemo.ss (in the collection) under IE4, IE5, IE5.5
  - check for no context menu in browsers
  - load mxdemo.ss into DrRacket; hit Run a second time,
     the browser windows should disappear
