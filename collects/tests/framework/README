		      Framework Test Suite Overview

Each tests will rely on the sucessfully completion of all of the ones
before it. In addition, all test suites rely on the sucessful
completion of the engine test suites and the mzscheme test suites.

All of these tests reside in PLTHOME/collects/tests/framework/

There will be a main mzscheme process which will start up a new mred
as necessary for the test suites. Since some tests actually require
mred to exit in order to pass, this governor is required. 

To run a test use:

   framework-test <test.ss> ...

where or <test.ss> is the name of one of the tests below.
(Note: uncomment the launcher entries in info.ss for this.)
Alternatively, pass no command-line arguments to run all of
the tests. (Under windows, the app will be named "Framework
Test"; see the mred-launcher-names documentation for how the
names change on the various platforms)

Some of the tests in this file are not yet present in the
testing directory. They are planned future expansions of
this test suite (and have been for some time....)

OS X: you will have to click on the newly started mred
processes in the doc while the test suite runs or it will
signal failures when there aren't any.

- load: |# load.ss #|

  | This tests that the advertised ways of loading the framework at
  | it's components all work.

- exit: |# exit.ss #|

  | This tests that exit:exit really exits and that the exit callbacks
  | are actually run.

- preferences: |# prefs.ss #|

  | This tests that preferences are saved and restored correctly, both
  | immediately and across reboots of mred.


- individual object tests:

  | These tests are simple object creation and basic operations.
  | Each test assumes that the others pass; this may yield strange
  | error messages when one fails.

  - frames: |# frame.ss #|
  - canvases: |# canvas.ss #|
  - texts: |# text.ss #|
  - pasteboards: |# pasteboard.ss #|

- keybindings: |# keys.ss #|

  | This tests the misc (non-scheme) keybindings

- searching: |# search.ss #|

  | This tests the seaching frame.

- info: |# info-frame.ss #|

  | This tests the info frame. (ie that toolbar on the bottom of the
                                screen)

- group tests: |# group-test.ss #|

  | make sure that mred:the-frame-group records frames correctly.
  | fake user input expected.

- scheme mode |# scheme.ss #|

  | Make sure that Scheme things work in scheme mode.

- saving tests:

  | These tests will make sure that the usual checks against a user
  | losing their work are in place.

  - autosaving: |# autosave.ss #|
  - closing: |# close.ss #|
  - quitting: |# quit.ss #|

- interactive tests

  | these tests require intervention by people. Clicking and whatnot
  
  - panel:single |# panel.ss #|

  - garbage collection: |# mem.ss #|

    | These tests will create objects in various configurations and
    | make sure that they are garbage collected
