#lang racket/base

;; To include a test, add an appropriate entry in `tests' below.
;; Notes:
;; - Each test is run in its own namespace, but there is very little
;;   additional sandboxing.  (There is a timeout of 10 minutes.)
;; - Specifically, the I/O ports are not diverted -- so please keep
;;   output to a minimum, preferrably nothing if there are no errors.
;; - Tests are only running in racket (*not* gracket), but note that
;;   they will run with both the default 3m and the CGC executable, and
;;   with the JIT enabled and disabled.
;; - They will also run on all build platforms, some can be slow (eg,
;;   the Solaris build, or if we get an ARM build).  Many of the build
;;   machines are used by people, be polite!
;; - The tests are usually run from some temporary directory, you can
;;   create files in it, but DO NOT use any other paths: don't write
;;   into the PLT tree, don't write into the home directory (or rely
;;   on things in it), assume a fresh planet cache.
;; - To signal failures, either raise an error, or `exit' with a
;;   positive code.  Obviously, make sure that failures print some
;;   indicative text for you.
;; - A semi-related note: the PLT tree compilation should not rely on
;;   planet packages, so if you use them, make sure you add a
;;   `compile-omit-paths' in your test's info file.

;; Tests to run:
;; - Each should be a `test' call, with the path to the test file to
;;   require (relative to this script).
