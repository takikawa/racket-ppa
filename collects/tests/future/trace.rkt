Invariants: 
-It is not possible for a future to have an empty timeline, even if it never 
 executes on anything other than the runtime thread.
-Cannot have two consecutive 'start-work events on the same future, same thread.
-For each future created there must exist exactly one 'create event. 
-The number of events matching synchronization-event? must always match the 
 number of runtime-synchronization-event? events.
