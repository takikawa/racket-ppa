;; ============================================================================
;; This file holds the specifications for creating Racket distributions.  These
;; specifications are defined by a sequence of <sym> := <spec>... definitions
;; (note: no parens), which binds the symbol to a tree specification.  In
;; addition, a definition can use `:=tag' which will go into a special space of
;; definitions that are used in `tag' forms.
;; Each <spec> is a form that can be a pattern string or a combination.
;; Pattern strings are matched recursively over path trees and they can:
;;   - contain shell-glob chars ("*" (will not match "/"s), "?", ranges),
;;   - the shell-globbing is extended with "{|}" which are used for alternative
;;     parts (the braces are translated to regexp parens),
;;   - have a "/" prefix to anchor the pattern at the path beginning,
;;   - have a "/" suffix to restrict the pattern to directories,
;;   - contain a "/**/" pattern to match over arbitrary directories nesting.
;; Pattens can be combined with a few primitive operators than can be taken as
;; operations over either predicates or sets:
;;   - `and', `or', `not' have usual meaning (can be considered as combining
;;     predicate functions or set operations),
;;   - `none', `all' are an always-false and always-true (useful for `cond's).
;; Expanding specs works as if the language is always splicing-in definitions,
;; which has no effects on most expression.  It does have an effect when a
;; symbol is defined as a sequence of specs, and in the conditional forms
;; below.
;; There are a few special spec forms that can be used to conditionalize
;; expressions:
;;   - (cond <cond> => <spec> ...
;;           ...
;;           else => <spec>)
;;     This is a conditional form: the condition can be a symbol which is true
;;     if this spec is achieved through a usage of a `tag' form (see below).
;;     `else' is the default condition.  The resulting spec(s) are spliced into
;;     the form they were used in -- which means that this form is used to
;;     modify an embedding spec form, unlike any of the above.  If no <cond>
;;     holds and no `else' is used, the `cond' form just disappears.  The
;;     condition can contain `and', `or', and `not' expressions.  A common
;;     idiom is:
;;       (- foo (cond (not bar) => baz))
;;     meaning that `foo' is used without `baz' when `bar' doesn't hold.
;;   - (cond* <cond> => <spec> ...
;;             ...)
;;     This is similar to the `cond' form, except that all matching branches
;;     are used, so this form is equivalent to:
;;       (cond <cond> => <spec> ...) ...
;;   - (tag <tag> <spec>) is the same as using <spec>, except that the <tag> is
;;     added to the expansion environment, so it is available for nested cond
;;     clauses.  Instead of a single <tag>, you can use a list of tags.  The
;;     tags are expanded using definitions made with :=tag, and the result is
;;     added to current tag list -- this expansion is a little different from
;;     the normal one in that the result contains all of the defintion it went
;;     through (so if x expands to y which expands to z, expanding x will
;;     result in x, y, and z).
;; Finally, it is possible to define `macro' constructs by using a lambda spec:
;;   - (lambda <args> <body>) if this is the only spec on a rhs of a
;;     definition, it is evaluated, and the resulting function is used to
;;     expand instances of what is bound to it.  The body itself is almost a
;;     normal lambda body, except that using multiple expressions will splice
;;     them into the calling location.
;; There are a few predefined macro constructs:
;;   - symbols are references to other spec definitions
;;   - `+' is a synonym for `or', `-' is for set-difference

;; ============================================================================
;; Distributions
;;   these are used to specify distributions, starting from the top and
;;   expanding down collecting the tags and the resulting tags are used to
;;   create the distribution file list.  The tags and the target entry name are
;;   strings to avoid expanding them prematurely.  When expansion gets to the
;;   `distribute!', it will use the tags to do a distribution with the given
;;   name -- converting them all to symbols.

;; exists too, and will choose to keep the `binary-keep' version.  It will do
;; some sanity checking: allow only the patterns that are listed below
;; (otherwise: error), also throw an error if some path has all three versions
;; (3m, cgc, and none).  These specs must contain a parenthesized regular
;; expressions.

;; The following three definitions are treated in a special way.  They specify
;; which files to get rid of so we get a clean 3m (or cgc) distribution (used
;; in all distributions except for the `full' ones) .  The first one is a set
;; of template specification -- each must have this form: "...<...!...>...".
;; The actual patterns are created by substituting "!" with the `binary-keep'
;; and `binary-throw' patters and removing the "<>"s.  Both resulting patterns
;; are searched in the tree.  Say that the pattern is "111<222!333>444", the
;; two patterns that will be used are "111222KEEP333444" and
;; "111222THROW333444".  Also, for every found path in the tree, the "<...>"
;; part is removed to get a `plain' version.  So we have possible triplet of
;; paths -- one with the throw pattern, one with the keep, and one without the
;; "<...>" part (called plain).  It is an error if all three exist; otherwise,
;; keep the `keep' path (or the `plain' if there is no `keep' path in this
;; set), and throw away the `throw' path (or the `plain' if there is no
;; `throw').  There is a sanity check that verifies that all 3m/cgc paths are
