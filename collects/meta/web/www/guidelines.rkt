        A test case ensures that functions fulfill their purpose and have the correct error

        For example, a test case for a queue library ensures that it deals correctly with
        enqueue and dequeue using small queues (say 3 or 4) and tests the corner cases. In

        Stress tests don't normally have an expected output, so they never "pass". The practice of
