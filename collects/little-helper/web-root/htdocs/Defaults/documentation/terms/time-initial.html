Browsers tend to send requests immediately, so a small number will do. Choosing a truely enormous number could cause problems. When a computer crashes or its network connection fails due to an external cause, it fails to ask the Web server to reclaim the connection. If about a thousand of these hung connections accumulate without timing out, the Web server can not accept new legitimate connections.</dd></dl><p>Powered by <a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/"><img width="53" height="19" src="/Defaults/documentation/plt-logo.gif" /></a></p></body></html>
