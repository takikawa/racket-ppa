;;; sort.scm  --  Jens Axel SÃ¸gaard

;;; PURPOSE

; This file contains routines for sorting files larger than main memory.

;;; DEPENDCIES

; Relies on vector-sort! from srfi-32 available from v35x.

;;; USAGE

; The file format is simply
;    <record><record><record>...

; The user provides read-record, which reads a <record>, and
; write-record that writes a record. 

; The main function is:

;  (disk-sort in-file out-file block-size read-record write-record less?)

; This will take the records in in-file, sort them according to less?, 
; and write them to out-file.
; The block-size indicates the number of records that can be sorted in-memory.
; It is okay to let in-file and out-file be the same.

;;; IMPLEMENTATION
