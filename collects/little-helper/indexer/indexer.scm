  ; This version stores the term numbers as gaps. This implies
  ; that we need to write the initial temporary file in sorted
  ; blocks. The tokenizing and the in-memory sorting phases are
  ; therefore combined.
  
  ;; The sort-based algorithm:
  
  ; 1.  For each term in each document a record is made in
  ;     a temporary file. 
  
  ;     A record consists of a term number, a document number
  ;     and the frequency of the term in the document.
  
  ; 2.  Internal sorting is done with MAX-RECORDS-IN-MEMORY
  ;     records at a time. Two records are compared first 
  ;     by term number, then by document number.
  
  ; 3.  Pairwise merging is used to get the whole file sorted.
  
  ; 4.  The inverted file is output.
