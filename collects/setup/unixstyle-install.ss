;; This file is used to move the PLT tree as part of a Unix sh-installer (when
;; it works in unix-style mode) and similar situations.  When possible (`move'
;; mode), this is done carefully (undoing changes if there is an error), and a
;; plt-uninstall script is generated.  It is also used to change an already
;; existing tree (eg, when DESTDIR is used) and to copy a tree (possibly part
;; of `make install').  There is no good cmdline interface, since it is
;; internal, and should be as independent as possible (it moves the collection
;; tree).  Expects these arguments:
;; * An operation verb:
;;   - `move': move a relative installation from `pltdir' to an absolute
;;     installation in the given paths (used by the shell installers)
;;     (interactive, undo-on-error, create-uninstaller)
;;   - `copy': similar to `move', but copies instead of moving
;;   - `make-install-copytree': copies some toplevel directories, skips .svn
;;     and compiled subdirs, and rewrite config.ss, but no uninstaller (used by
;;     `make install') (requres an additional `origtree' argument)
;;   - `make-install-destdir-fix': fixes paths in binaries, laucnhers, and
;;     config.ss (used by `make install' to fix a DESTDIR) (requires exactly
;;     the same args as `make-install-copytree' (prefixed) and requires a
;;     proper DESTDIR setting)
;; * pltdir: The source plt directory
;; * Path names that should be moved/copied (bin, collects, doc, lib, ...)
