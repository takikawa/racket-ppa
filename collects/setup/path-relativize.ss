  ;; Historical note: this module is based on the old "plthome.ss"

  ;; The `path->main-relative' and `main-relative->path' functions
  ;; that this generates are used to store paths that are relative to
  ;; the main directory (specified by `find-main-dir'), such as in
  ;; .dep files.  This means that if the plt tree is moved, .dep files
  ;; still work.  It is generally fine if `path->main-relative' misses
  ;; some usages, as long as it works when we prepare a distribution
  ;; tree.  (If it misses, things will continue to work fine and .dep
  ;; files will contain absolute path names.)

  ;; We need to compare paths to find when something is in the plt
  ;; tree, so we explode the paths. This slower than the old way (by
  ;; a factor of 2 or so), but it's simpler and more portable.
