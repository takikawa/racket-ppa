Writes the given @racket[bitmap] to @racket[filename] as a GIF image,
where @racket[bitmap] is either an instance of @racket[bitmap%] or a
thunk (to be called just once) that generates such an object. If the
bitmap uses more than 256 colors, it is automatically quantized using
a simple algorithm; see @racket[quantize]. If the bitmap has a mask
bitmap via @method[bitmap% get-loaded-mask], it is used to determine
transparent pixels in the generated GIF image.}

         void?]{

Writes the bitmaps in @racket[bitmaps] to @racket[filename] as an
animated GIF. The @racket[bitmaps] list can contain a mixture of
@racket[bitmap%] objects and thunks (each called just once) that
produce @racket[bitmap%] objects. The @racket[delay-csec] argument is
the amount of time in 1/100s of a second to wait between transitions.
If @racket[loop?] is a true value, then the GIF is marked as a looping
animation.

If @racket[one-at-a-time?] is @racket[#f], then the content of all
images is collected and quantized at once, to produce a single
colortable; a drawback to this approach is that it uses more memory,
and it allows less color variation among animation frames. Even when
@racket[one-at-a-time?] is @racket[#f], the result of each thunk in
@racket[bitmaps] is converted to a byte-string one at a time.

If @racket[one-at-a-time?] is true, then the bitmaps are quantized and
written to the file one at a time; that is, for each thunk in
@racket[bitmaps], its result is written and discarded before another
thunk is called. A drawback to this approach is that a separate
colortable is written for each frame in the animation, which can make
the resulting file large.

If @racket[last-frame-delay] is not false, a delay of
@racket[last-frame-delay] (in 1/100s of a second) is added to the last
frame. This extra delay is useful when @racket[loop?] is true.}
