Test Box Recovery Tool
----------------------

This tool allows DrScheme v370 and later to read programs created
using v360 and earlier that include test-case boxes.

When opened using this tool, test-case boxes rae turned into
`check-expect' forms that work with the "testing.ss" teachpack.

Test boxes plain-text tests and expected results are converted to
plain-text `check-expect' forms. 

If either the test or espected-result expression contains non-text
(e.g., an image), the converted form is a comment box containing a
`check-expect' form. The box should be easy to remove using the
"Uncomment" menu item in DrScheme.
