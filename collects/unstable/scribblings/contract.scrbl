@defproc[(non-empty-string? [x any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[x] is a string and is not empty;
returns @racket[#f] otherwise.
}

@defthing[port-number? contract?]{
Equivalent to @racket[(between/c 1 65535)].
}

@defthing[tcp-listen-port? contract?]{
Equivalent to @racket[(between/c 0 65535)].
}

@defthing[path-piece? contract?]{
Equivalent to @racket[(or/c path-string? (symbols 'up 'same))].
}

@defproc[(if/c [predicate (-> any/c any/c)]
               [then-contract contract?]
               [else-contract contract?])
         contract?]{

Produces a contract that, when applied to a value, first tests the
value with @racket[predicate]; if @racket[predicate] returns true, the
@racket[then-contract] is applied; otherwise, the
@racket[else-contract] is applied. The resulting contract is a flat
contract if both @racket[then-contract] and @racket[else-contract] are
flat contracts.

For example, the following contract enforces that if a value is a
procedure, it is a thunk; otherwise it can be any (non-procedure)
value:
  @racketblock[(if/c procedure? (-> any) any/c)]
Note that the following contract is @bold{not} equivalent:
  @racketblock[(or/c (-> any) any/c) (code:comment "wrong!")]
The last contract is the same as @racket[any/c] because
@racket[or/c] tries flat contracts before higher-order contracts.
}

@defthing[failure-result/c contract?]{

A contract that describes the failure result arguments of procedures
such as @racket[hash-ref].

Equivalent to @racket[(if/c procedure? (-> any) any/c)].
}

@defproc[(rename-contract [contract contract?]
                          [name any/c])
         contract?]{

Produces a contract that acts like @racket[contract] but with the name
@racket[name].

The resulting contract is a flat contract if @racket[contract] is a
flat contract.
}

@addition{Asumu Takikawa}

@defproc[(maybe/c [contract contract?]) contract?]{

Creates a contract that acts like @racket[contract] but will also
accept @racket[#f]. Intended to describe situations where a failure
or default value may be used.
}

@defthing[truth/c flat-contract?]{

This contract recognizes Scheme truth values, i.e., any value, but with a more
informative name and description.  Use it in negative positions for arguments
that accept arbitrary truth values that may not be booleans.

}

@defproc[(sequence/c [elem/c contract?] ...) contract?]{

Wraps a @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{sequence},
obligating it to produce as many values as there are @racket[elem/c] contracts,
and obligating each value to satisfy the corresponding @racket[elem/c].  The
result is not guaranteed to be the same kind of sequence as the original value;
for instance, a wrapped list is not guaranteed to satisfy @racket[list?].

@defproc[(treeof [elem-contract contract?]) contract?]{
Identifies values that meet the contract @racket[elem-contract], lists of such values, lists of lists, and so on.
