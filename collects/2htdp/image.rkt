Need to test copy & paste. Also test that if the "if" 
expression in image-snipclass%'s read
method returns #f, then you get a black circle out.

---

improvments/changes wrt to htdp/image:

  - copying and pasting does not introduce jaggies
  - equal comparisons are more efficient
  - added rotation & scaling
  - got rid of pinholes (see the new overlay, beside, and above functions)
  - a bunch of new polygon functions

todo: sort out wxme library support (loading in text mode).

------------

From Matthias: (to use to compare with this library)


You asked about exercises and code snippets for HtDP/2e yesterday. I actually do have a bunch of stuff in

 svn: 2HtDP/SampleCode/

and they all have good sample contracts. (It is amazing what we can do with kids who have just a few weeks of cs down; I would have never dared to write an editor after six weeks in Algol.)
