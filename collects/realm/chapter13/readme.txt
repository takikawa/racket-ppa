This chapter implements a distributed version of the "guess my number" game. 

TO PLAY, open the file

	 run.rkt 

in DrRacket. The instructions for playing are at the top of the file. 

TO EXPERIMENT, open the files 

	 -- run.rkt 
	 -- server.rkt 
	 -- client.rkt 
	 -- shared.rkt 

in four different tabs or windows in DrRacket. Switch to the 'run.rkt'
tab and select 

  View | Show Module browser

to see how these files are related. To switch to one of these four files, 
you may click the boxes in the module browsers. Alternatively click the 
tab you wish to work on. It is also possible to select tabs via key
strokes. 

Each file except for 'run.rkt' comes with test submodules at the bottom of
the file.
