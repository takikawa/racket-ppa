;; this implements the Delta environment from the TOPLAS paper
;; (as well as every other paper on System F)

;; this environment maps type variables names (symbols)
;; to types representing the type variable
;; technically, the mapped-to type is unnecessary, but it's convenient to have it around? maybe?

;; this is used in the parsing of types
