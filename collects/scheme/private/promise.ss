;; that is iterated through them.

;; This is similar to the *new* version of srfi-45 -- see the
;; post-finalization discussion at http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-45/ for
;; more details; specifically, this version is the `lazy2' version from
;; http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-45/post-mail-archive/msg00013.html.
;; Note: if you use only `force'+`delay' it behaves as in Scheme (except
;; that `force' is identity for non promise values), and `force'+`lazy'
;; are sufficient for implementing the lazy language.
