This document explains basic usage of Dan Ignatoff's spreadsheet,
which is in ft-spread.ss.

File Menu
---------
Load: Loads a saved spreadsheed in a new window.
Save: Saves the current spreadsheet
(Save is not sensitive to state, it merely
stores the formulas of the cells)

Interactions
------------
Clicking on a cell selects the cell. If you are
pressing ctrl, it will add the cell to the current
group of cells being selected. If you are not 
pressing ctrl, then only the last selected cell
will be selected.

Whevever a cell is selected, the formula buffer
is cleared and replaced with the content of that
cell.

After a cell is selected, type a formula into the
formula field.

Pressing return sets the formulas of all selected
cells to be the formula in the formula field.

Pressing f1 will set the copy buffer (not visualized)
to be the current value of the text field.

Pressing f2 will clear the formula buffer, and
set it to the current value of the copy buffer.

Cell Language
-------------
The language usable in the cells is FrTime,
with the following additions:

'row' and 'col' are parameters that store the
row and column of the cell in which they are
part of the formula.

(get-cell-val column row)
get-cell-val evaluates the formula at the
specified column and row, and returns the value.

examples:
(get-cell-val 0 0)
gets the value of the cell at (0,0)

(get-cell-val (col) 0)
gets the value of the cell in the same column
as the cell where this is the forumla, whose row
is zero.

(get-cell-val (+ 1 (col)) (row))
gets the value of the cell immediately to the
right of the cell where this is the formula.
