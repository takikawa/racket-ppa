This directory a the PLT Redex implementation of the
R6RS operational semantics and a test suite for the
semantics.

== r6rs.rkt: the semantics itself.

== r6rs-tests.rkt: the test suite for the semantics. Use:

   racket -t r6rs-tests.rkt -m

   to run the tests and see a single period shown per test
   run (each test that explores more than 100 states shows a
   colon for each 100 states it explores). To see a more
   verbose output (that shows each test), use:

   racket -t r6rs-tests.rkt -m #t

== show-examples.rkt: use this file to explore particular
   examples in a GUI. Its content shows how to use it and
   gives a few examples. Either run it in DrRacket's module
   language, or like this from the commandline:

   gracket show-examples.rkt

== test.rkt: test suite infrastructure
