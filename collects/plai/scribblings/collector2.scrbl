@title[#:tag "gc2-collector"]{GC Collector Language, 2}

@defmodulelang[plai/gc2/collector]

@COLLECT-LANG is based on @seclink["plai-scheme"]{PLAI}.  It provides
additional procedures and syntax for writing garbage collectors.

@section{Garbage Collector Interface for GC2}

The @COLLECT-LANG language provides the following functions that provide access
to the heap and root set:

@defproc[(heap-size) exact-nonnegative-integer?]{

Returns the size of the heap.  The size of the heap is specified by the mutator
that uses the garbage collector.  See @racket[allocator-setup] for more
information.
}

@defproc[(location? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{
  Determines if @racket[v] is an integer between @racket[0] and
  @racket[(- (heap-size) 1)] inclusive.
}

@defproc[(root? [v any/c])
         boolean?]{
Determines if @racket[v] is a root.
}

@defproc[(heap-value? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  A value that may be stored on the heap. Roughly corresponds to the contract
  @racket[(or/c boolean? number? procedure? symbol? empty?)].
}


@defproc[(heap-set! (loc location?) (val heap-value?)) void?]{
  Sets the value at @racket[_loc] to @racket[_val].
}

@defproc[(heap-ref (loc location?)) heap-value?]{
  Returns the value at @racket[_loc].
}

@defform[(get-root-set)]{
  Returns the current @racket[root?]s as a list. This returns
  valid roots only when invoked via the mutator language. Otherwise
  it returns only what has been set up with @racket[with-roots].
}

@defproc[(read-root (root root?)) location?]{
  Returns the location of @racket[_root].
}

@defproc[(set-root! (root root?) (loc location?)) void?]{
  Updates @racket[root] to refer to @racket[loc].
}

@defproc[(make-root [name symbol?] [get (-> location?)] [set (-> location? void?)])
         root?]{
  Creates a new root. When @racket[read-root] is called, it invokes
  @racket[get] and when @racket[set-root!] is called, it invokes
  @racket[set].
  
  For example, this creates a root that uses the local variable
  @racket[x] to hold its location:
  @racketblock[(let ([x 1])
                 (make-root 'x
                            (位 () x)
                            (位 (new-x) (set! x new-x))))]
}

@defform[(with-heap heap-expr body-expr ...)
         #:contracts ([heap-expr (vectorof heap-value?)])]{
 Evaluates each of the @racket[body-expr]s in a context where
 the value of @racket[heap-expr] is used as the heap. Useful in
 tests:
 @racketblock[
  (test (with-heap (make-vector 20) 
          (init-allocator)
          (gc:deref (gc:alloc-flat 2)))
        2)
  ]}
                                                     
@defform[(with-roots (root-var ...) expr1 expr2 ...)
         #:contracts ([roots-expr (listof location?)])]{
  Evaluates each of @racket[expr1] and the @racket[expr2]s in
  in a context with additional roots, one for each of
  the @racket[root-var]s. The @racket[get-root-set] function
  returns these additional roots. Calling @racket[read-root] on
  one of the newly created roots returns the value of the 
  corresponding @racket[root-var] and calling @racket[set-root!]
  mutates the corresponding variable.
  
  This form is intended to be used in test suites
  for collectors. Since your test suites are not running
  in the @racketmod[plai/gc2/mutator] language, @racket[get-root-set]
  returns a list consisting only of the roots it created,
  not all of the other roots it normally would return.
  Use @racket[with-roots] to note specific locations as roots
  and set up better tests for your GC.
  
  @racketblock[
    (test (with-heap (make-vector 4)
                     (define f1 (gc:alloc-flat 1))
                     (define r1 (make-root 'f1 
                                           (位 () f1)
                                           (位 (v) (set! f1 v))))
                     (define c1 (gc:cons r1 r1))
                     (with-roots (c1)
                                 (gc:deref
                                  (gc:first
                                   (gc:cons r1 r1)))))
          1)]
  
}

@section{Garbage Collector Exports for GC2}

@declare-exporting[#:use-sources (plai/scribblings/fake-collector2)]

A garbage collector must define the following functions:

@defproc[(init-allocator) void?]{

@racket[init-allocator] is called before all other procedures by a
mutator. Place any requisite initialization code here.

}

@defproc[(gc:deref (loc location?)) heap-value?]{

Given the location of a flat value, this procedure should return that
value.  If the location does not hold a flat value, this function should signal
an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:alloc-flat (val heap-value?)) location?]{

This procedure should allocate a flat value (number, symbol, boolean,
closure or empty list) on the heap, returning its location (a number). The
value should occupy a single heap cell, though you may use additional space to
store a tag, etc. You are also welcome to pre-allocate common constants (e.g.,
the empty list). This procedure may need to perform a garbage-collection. If
there is still insufficient space, it should signal an error.

Note that closures are flat values. The environment of a closure is internally
managed, but contains references to values on the heap. Therefore, during
garbage collection, the environment of reachable closures must be updated. The
language exposes the environment via the @racket[procedure-roots] function.

}

@defproc[(gc:cons (first root?) (rest root?)) location?]{

Given two roots, one for the @racket[first] and @racket[rest] values, this
procedure must allocate a cons cell on the heap.  If there is insufficient
space to allocate the cons cell, it should signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:first (cons-cell location?)) location?]{

If the given location refers to a cons cell, this should return the first
field. Otherwise, it should signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:rest (cons-cell location?)) location?]{

If the given location refers to a cons cell, this should return the rest
field. Otherwise, it should signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:set-first! (cons-cell location?) (first-value location?)) void?]{

If @racket[cons-cell] refers to a cons cell, set the head of the cons cell to
@racket[first-value].  Otherwise, signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:set-rest! (cons-cell location?) (rest-value location?)) void?]{

If @racket[cons-cell] refers to a cons cell, set the tail of the cons cell to
@racket[rest-value].  Otherwise, signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:cons? (loc location?)) boolean?]{


Returns @racket[#true] if @racket[loc] refers to a cons cell.  This function
should never signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:flat? (loc location?)) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#true] if @racket[loc] refers to a flat value.  This function
should never signal an error.

}

@defproc[(gc:closure [code-ptr heap-value?] [free-vars (listof root?)]) 
         location?]{
  Allocates a closure with @racket[code-ptr] and the free variables
  in the list @racket[free-vars].
}
@defproc[(gc:closure-code-ptr [loc location?]) heap-value?]{
 Given a location returned from an earlier allocation
 check to see if it is a closure; if not signal an
 error. if so, return the @racket[_code-ptr] for that closure.
}

@defproc[(gc:closure-env-ref [loc location?] [i exact-nonnegative-integer?])
         location?]{
  Given a location returned from an earlier allocation, check
  to see if it is a closure; if not signal an error. Uf so,
  return the @racket[i]th variable in the closure (counting from 0).
}

@defproc[(gc:closure? [loc location?]) boolean?]{
  Determine if a previously allocated location 
  holds a closure. This function will be called only
  with locations previous returned from an allocating
  function or passed to @racket[set-root!]. It should
  never signal an error.
}
