@defmodule[math/statistics]

This module exports functions that compute @deftech{statistics}, meaning summary values for
collections of samples, and functions for managing sequences of weighted or unweighted samples.

Most of the functions that compute statistics accept a sequence of nonnegative reals that
correspond one-to-one with sample values.
These are used as weights; equivalently counts, pseudocounts or unnormalized probabilities.
While this makes it easy to work with weighted samples, it introduces some subtleties
in bias correction.
In particular, central moments must be computed without bias correction by default.
See @secref{stats:expected-values} for a discussion.

@section[#:tag "stats:expected-values"]{Expected Values}

Functions documented in this section that compute higher central moments, such as @racket[variance],
@racket[stddev] and @racket[skewness], can optionally apply bias correction to their estimates.
For example, when @racket[variance] is given the argument @racket[#:bias #t], it
multiplies the result by @racket[(/ n (- n 1))], where @racket[n] is the number of samples.

The meaning of ``bias correction'' becomes less clear with weighted samples, however. Often, the
weights represent counts, so when moment-estimating functions receive @racket[#:bias #t], they
interpret it as ``use the sum of @racket[ws] for @racket[n].''
In the following example, the sample @racket[4] is first counted twice and then given weight
@racket[2]; therefore @racket[n = 5] in both cases:
@interaction[#:eval typed-eval
                    (variance '(1 2 3 4 4) #:bias #t)
                    (variance '(1 2 3 4) '(1 1 1 2) #:bias #t)]

However, sample weights often do not represent counts. For these cases, the @racket[#:bias]
keyword can be followed by a real-valued pseudocount, which is used for @racket[n]:
@interaction[#:eval typed-eval
                    (variance '(1 2 3 4) '(1/2 1/2 1/2 1) #:bias 5)]

Because the magnitude of the bias correction for weighted samples cannot be known without user
guidance, in all cases, the bias argument defaults to @racket[#f].

@defproc[(mean [xs (Sequenceof Real)] [ws (U #f (Sequenceof Real)) #f]) Real]{
When @racket[ws] is @racket[#f] (the default), returns the sample mean of the values in @racket[xs].
Otherwise, returns the weighted sample mean of the values in @racket[xs] with corresponding weights
@racket[ws].

The @racket[statistics] object allows computing the sample minimum, maximum, count, mean, variance,
skewness, and excess kurtosis of a sequence of samples in O(1) space.

To use it, start with @racket[empty-statistics], then use @racket[update-statistics] to obtain a
new statistics object with updated values. Use @racket[statistics-min], @racket[statistics-mean],
and similar functions to get the current estimates.

Sorts possibly weighted samples according to @racket[lt?], which is assumed to define a total
order over the elements in @racket[xs].

Because @racket[sort-samples] is defined in terms of @racket[sort], the sort is only guaranteed
to be stable if @racket[lt?] is strictly a less-than relation.

@defproc[(median [lt? (A A -> Any)] [xs (Sequenceof A)] [ws (U #f (Sequenceof Real)) #f]) A]{
Equivalent to @racket[(quantile 1/2 lt? xs ws)].

Computes the inverse of the empirical @tech{cdf} represented by the samples @racket[xs],
which are optionally weighted by @racket[ws].

@examples[#:eval typed-eval
                 (quantile 0 < '(1 3 5))
                 (quantile 0.5 < '(1 2 3 4))

If @racket[p = 0], @racket[quantile] returns the smallest element of @racket[xs] under the
ordering relation @racket[lt?]. If @racket[p = 1], it returns the largest element.

For weighted samples, @racket[quantile] sorts @racket[xs] and @racket[ws] together
(using @racket[sort-samples]), then finds the least @racket[x] for which the proportion of its
cumulative weight is greater than or equal to @racket[p].

For unweighted samples, @racket[quantile] uses the quickselect algorithm to find the element that
would be at index @racket[(ceiling (- (* p n) 1))] if @racket[xs] were sorted, where @racket[n]
is the length of @racket[xs].

@defproc[(absdev [xs (Sequenceof Real)] [ws (U #f (Sequenceof Real)) #f]) Nonnegative-Real]{
Computes the average absolute difference between the elements in @racket[xs] and
@racket[(median < xs ws)]. If @racket[ws] is not @racket[#f], it is a weighted average.
}

@defproc[(absdev/median [median Real] [xs (Sequenceof Real)] [ws (U #f (Sequenceof Real)) #f])
         Nonnegative-Real]{
Like @racket[(absdev xs ws)], but computed using known median @racket[median].
