  ;; this file is badly named; it contains
  ;; all of the code used at runtime by the
  ;; various annotations inserted by this 
  ;; library.
  
  ;; Defining `errortrace-key' as a funciton is a performance hack:
  ;; the compiler can track function constants, and in particular the
  ;; fact that it's not an impersonated/chaperoned mark key, so that a
  ;; `with-continuation-mark' using this key can be dropped if the
  ;; body expression is simple.
