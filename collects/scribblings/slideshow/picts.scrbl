@defmodule*/no-declare[(slideshow/pict)]{ The
@schememodname[slideshow/pict] layer provides core functions for
constructing pictures, and it is independent of the slide viewer. This
layer can be used, for example, to generate a picture as encapsulated
PostScript for inclusion into a larger document. The
@schememodname[slideshow/pict] layer is re-provided by the
@schememodname[slideshow] language.}

@section{Pict Datatype}

A picture is a @scheme[pict] structure. Some functions, such as
@scheme[hline], create new simple picts. Other functions, such as
@scheme[ht-append], build new picts out of existing picts. In the
latter case, the embedded picts retain their identity, so that
offset-finding functions, such as @scheme[lt-find], can find the
offset of an embedded pict in a larger pict.

In addition to its drawing part, a pict has the following
@deftech{bounding box} structure:

@verbatim[#:indent 7]{
           w
   ------------------
  |                  | a  \
  |------------------|    |
  |                  |    | h
  |----------last----|    |
  |                  | d  /
   ------------------
}

That is, the bounding box has a width @math{w} and a height
@math{h}. For a single text line, @math{d} is descent below the
baseline, and @math{a+d=h}. For multiple text lines (often created
with a function like @scheme[vc-append]), @math{a} is the ascent of
the top line, and @math{d} is the descent of the bottom line, so
@math{a+d<h}. Many picts have @math{d=0} and @math{a=h}.

In addition, a pict can have a @defterm{last} sub-pict that
corresponds to the last item on the last line of text, so that extra
lines can be added to the last line. In particular, the @defterm{last}
element is useful for adding closing parentheses to a block of Scheme
code, where the last line of code not the longest line in the block.

The size information for a pict is computed when the pict is
created. This strategy supports programs that create new picts though
arbitrarily complex computations on the size and shape of existing
picts. The functions @scheme[pict-width], @scheme[pict-height],
@scheme[pict-descent], and @scheme[pict-ascent] extract bounding-box
information from a pict.


@defstruct[pict ([draw ((is-a?/c dc<%>) real? real? . -> . any)]
                 [width real?]
                 [height real?]

                 [panbox (or/c false/c any/c)]
                 [last (or/c false/c pict?)])]{

A @scheme[pict] structure is normally not created directly with
@scheme[make-pict]. Instead, functions like @scheme[text],
@scheme[hline], and @scheme[dc] are used to construct a pict.

The @scheme[draw] field contains the pict's drawing procedure, which
takes a @scheme[dc<%>] drawing context and an offset for the pict's
top-left corner (i.e., it's bounding box's top left corner relative to
the @scheme[dc<%>] origin). The state of the @scheme[dc<%>] is
intended to affect the pict's drawing; for example, the pen and brush
will be set for a suitable default drawing mode, and the
@scheme[dc<%>] scale will be set to scale the resulting image.

The @scheme[panbox] field is internal, and it should be ininitialized
to @scheme[#f].

The @scheme[last] field indicates a pict within the @scheme[children]
list (transitively) that can be treated as the last element of the
last line in the pict. A @scheme[#f] value means that the pict is its
own last sub-pict.}


@defstruct[child ([pict pict?]
                  [dx real?]
                  [dy real?]
                  [sx real?]
                  [sy real?])]{

Records, for a pict constructed of other picts, the relative location
and scale of one nested pict.

A @scheme[child] structure is normally not created directly with
@scheme[make-child]. Instead, functions like @scheme[hc-append] create
@scheme[child] structures when combining picts to create a new one.}

            pict?])]{

Creates an arbitrary self-rendering pict.  The arguments to the
rendering procedure will be a device context and top-left location for
drawing.
  
When the rendering procedure is called, the current pen and brush will
be solid and in the pict's color (and linewidth), and the scale and
offset of the dc will be set. The text mode will be transparent, but
the font and text colors are not guaranteed to be anything in
particular.}

@defproc*[([(blank [size real? 0]) pict?]
           [(blank [w real?][h real?]) pict?]
           [(blank [w real?][a real?][d real?]) pict?]
           [(blank [w real?][h real?][a real?][d real?]) pict?])]{

Creates a pict that draws nothing. The one-argument case supplies a
value sued for both the width and height. In the one- and two-argument
case, the ascent and descent are @math{0} for the resulting pict's
bounding box; in the three-argument case, the height is computed by
adding the given ascent and descent.}

@defproc[(text [content string?]

               [angle real? 0])
         pict?]{

Creates a pict that draws text. For creating text picts within a slide
presentation, see @scheme[t], instead. Otherwise, before calling this
function, a drawing context must be installed with
@scheme[dc-for-text-size].

The @scheme[style] argument must be one of the following:

@itemize{

 @item{@scheme[null] --- the default, same as @scheme['default]}

 @item{a @scheme[font%] object}

 @item{a font family symbol, such a @scheme['roman] (see @scheme[font%])}

 @item{a font face string, such as @scheme["Helvetica"] (see @scheme[font%])}

 @item{@scheme[(cons _str _sym)] combining a face string and a font
       family (in case the face is unavailable; see @scheme[font%])}

 @item{@scheme[(cons 'bold style)] for a valid @scheme[style]}

 @item{@scheme[(cons 'italic style)]}
 @item{@scheme[(cons 'subscript style)]}
 @item{@scheme[(cons 'superscript style)]}
 @item{@scheme[(cons 'caps style)]}

 @item{@scheme[(cons 'combine style)] --- allows kerning and ligatures
      (the default, unless the @scheme['modern] family is specified)}

 @item{@scheme[(cons 'no-combine style)] --- renders characters individually}
}

If both @scheme['combine] and @scheme['no-combine] are specified, the
first one takes precedence. If caps is specified, the angle must be
zero.

The given @scheme[size] is in pixels, but it is ignored if a
@scheme[font%] object is provided in the text-style.

The @scheme[rotation] is in radians, and positive values rotate
counter-clockwise. For a non-zero @scheme[rotation], the resulting
pict's bounding box covers the rotated text, and the descent is zero
and the ascent is the height.}

Unfilled and filled rectangles with rounded corners.  The
@scheme[corner-radius] is used to determine how much
rounding occurs in the corners. If it is a positive number,
then it determines the radius of a circle touching the edges
in each corner, and the rounding of the rectangle follow the
edge of those circles. If it is a negative number, then the
radius of the circles in the corners is the absolute value of the
@scheme[corner-radius] times the smaller of @scheme[width]

The @scheme[angle] determines how much the rectangle is
rotated, in radians.

@defproc[(bitmap [img (or/c path-string? (is-a?/c bitmap%))])
         pict]{

A pict that display a bitmap. When a path is provided, the image is
loaded with the @scheme['unknown/mask] flag, which means that a mask
bitmap is generated if the file contains a mask.

If the bitmap cannot be loaded, if the given @scheme[bitmap%] object
is not valid, or if the @scheme[bitmap-draft-mode] parameter is set to
@scheme[#t], the result pict draws the word ``bitmap failed''.}

Creates a line (with some number of arrowheads) as a zero-sized pict
suitable for use with @scheme[pin-over]. The 0-sized picture contains
the starting point.

The @scheme[size] is used for the arrowhead size. Even though
@scheme[pip-line] creates no arrowheads, it accepts the @scheme[size]
argument for consistency with the other functions.}

@scheme[row-seps] arguments are ``lists'' specifying the row and
columns alignments separation between rows and columns.  For @math{c}
columns and @math{r} rows, the first two should have @math{c} and
@math{r} superimpose procedures, and the last two should have
@math{c-1} and @math{r-1} numbers, respectively. The lists can be

Creates a fish swimming either @scheme['left] or @scheme['right].
If @scheme[eye-color] is @scheme[#f], no eye is drawn.

The @scheme[open-mouth] argument can be either @scheme[#f] (mouth
closed), @scheme[#t] (mouth fully open), or a number: @scheme[0.0] is

@subsection{Balloon Annotations}

@defmodule[slideshow/balloon]{The @schememodname[slideshow/balloon]
library provides functions for creating and placing cartoon-speech
balloons.}

@defproc[(wrap-balloon [pict pict?]
                       [spike one-of/c ('n 's 'e 'w 'ne 'se 'sw 'nw)]
                       [dx real?]

                       [corner-radius (and/c real? (not/c negative?)) 32])
         balloon?]{

Superimposes @scheme[pict] on top of a balloon that wraps it.

The @scheme[spike] argument indicates the corner from which a spike
protrudes from the balloon (i.e., the spike that points to whatever
the balloon is about). For example, @scheme['n] means ``north,'',
which is a spike in the top middle of the balloon.

The @scheme[dx] and @scheme[dy] arguments specify how far the spike
should protrude.  For a @scheme['w] spike, @scheme[dx] should be
negative, etc.

The @scheme[color] argument is the background color for the balloon.

The @scheme[corner-radius] argument determines the radius of the cicle
used to roun the balloon's corners. As usual, if it is less than
@scheme[1], then it acts as a ratio of the balloon's width or height.

The result is a balloon, not a pict. The @scheme[balloon-pict]
function extracts a pict whose bounding box does not include the
spike, but includes the rest of the image, and the
@scheme[balloon-point-x] and @scheme[balloon-point-y] functions
extract the location of the spike point. More typically, the
@scheme[pin-balloon] function is used to add a balloon to a pict.}

Superimposes the pict in @scheme[balloon] onto @scheme[base] to
produce a new pict. The balloon is positioned so that its spike points
to the location specified by either @scheme[x] and @scheme[y]
(numbers) or at the position determined by combining @scheme[base] and
@scheme[at-pict] with @scheme[find]. The @scheme[find] function uses
its arguments like @scheme[lt-find].
