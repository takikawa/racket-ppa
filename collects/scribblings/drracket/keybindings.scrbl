@title{Keyboard Shortcuts}

@index['("keybindings")]{Most} key presses simply insert a character
into the editor, such as @litchar{a}, @litchar{3}, or
@litchar{(}. Other keys and key combinations act as keyboard shortcuts
that move the blinking caret, delete a line, copy the selection,
etc. Keyboard shortcuts are usually trigger by key combinations using
the Control, Meta, or Command key.

@margin-note{Many of the key-binding actions can also be performed
with menu items.}

C-@nonterm{key} means press the Control key, hold it down and then
press @nonterm{key} and then release them both. For example: C-e
(Control-E) moves the blinking caret to the end of the current line.

M-@nonterm{key} is the same as C-@nonterm{key}, except with the Meta
key.  Depending on your keyboard, Meta may be called ``Left,''
``Right,'' or have a diamond symbol, but it's usually on the bottom
row next to the space bar. M-@nonterm{key} can also be performed as a
two-character sequence: first, strike and release the Escape key, then
strike @nonterm{key}. Under Windows and Mac OS X, Meta is only
available through the Escape key.

DEL is the Delete key.

SPACE is the Space bar.
  
On most keyboards, ``<'' and ``>'' are shifted characters. So, to
get M->, you actually have to type Meta-Shift->. That is, press and
hold down both the Meta and Shift keys, and then strike ``>''.

Under Windows, some of these keybindings are actually standard menu
items.  Those keybindings will behave according to the menus, unless
the @onscreen{Enable keybindings in menus} preference is unchecked.

@index['("Emacs keybindings")]{If} you are most familiar with
Emacs-style key bindings, you should uncheck the @onscreen{Enable
keybindings in menus} preference. Many of the keybindings below are
inspired by Emacs.}

@section[#:tag "defining-shortcuts"]{Defining Custom Shortcuts}

 The @onscreen{Add User-defined Keybindings...} menu item in the
 @onscreen{Keybindings} sub-menu of @onscreen{Edit} selects a file
 containing Racket definitions of keybindings. The file must contain a
 module that uses a special keybindings language,
 @racket[framework/keybinding-lang]. To do so, begin your file with
 this line:

@racketmod[
s-exp framework/keybinding-lang
]

The @racket[framework/keybinding-lang] languages provides all of the bindings
from @racketmodname[racket], @racketmodname[racket/class], and
@racketmodname[drracket/tool-lib], 
except that it adjusts @|mz-mod-begin| to
introduce a @racketidfont{keybinding} form:

@specform[#:literals (keybindings)
          (keybinding string-expr proc-expr)]{

Declares a keybinding, where @racket[string-expr] must produce a
suitable first argument for @xmethod[keymap% map-function], and the
@racket[proc-expr] must produce a suitable second argument for
@xmethod[keymap% add-function].}

For example, this remaps the key combination ``control-a'' key to ``!''.

@racketmod[
s-exp framework/keybinding-lang
(keybinding "c:a" (Î» (editor evt) (send editor insert "!")))
]

Note that DrRacket does not reload this file automatically when you
make a change, so you'll need to restart DrRacket to see changes to
the file.
