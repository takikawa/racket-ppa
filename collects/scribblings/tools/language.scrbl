   printing-style  (code:comment @#,t{(symbols 'constructor 'quasiquote 'write 'print)})

The settings in this structure reflect the settings show in
the language configuration dialog for languages constructed

language. The rest specify printing controls for the
language. The style @scheme['write] is the default style,
used in the MzScheme REPL. The sharing field determines if
cycles and sharing in values are displayed when the value is
rendered. The insert newlines field determines if values in
the repl are formatted with @scheme[write] style-line
printouts, or with @scheme[pretty-print] multi-line printouts.

@scheme[front-end/complete-program] method reads, parses,
and optionally compiles a program in the language. The first
argument contains all of the data to be read (until eof) and
the second argument is a value representing the source of
the program (typically an editor, but may also be a string
naming a file or some other value).

The third argument is the current settings
for the language. The @scheme[front-end/complete-program]
method is expected to return a thunk that is called
repeatedly to get all of the expressions in the
program. When all expressions have been read, the thunk is
expected to return @scheme[eof].

This method is only called for programs in the definitions
window. Notably, it is not called for
programs that are @scheme[load]ed or @scheme[eval]ed.
See
@scheme[current-load] and 
@scheme[current-eval]

This method is expected to raise an appropriate exception if
the program is malformed, eg an @scheme[exn:syntax] or
@scheme[exn:read].

This is called on the user's thread, as is the thunk it
returns.

Implementations of this method should not return fully
expanded expressions, since there are two forms of
expansion, using either
@scheme[expand]
or 
@scheme[expand-top-level-with-compile-time-evals]

the same strings (as given by the

This method returns a list of strings that is used to
organize this language with the other languages. Each entry
in that list is a category or subcategory of the language
and the last entry in the list is the name of the language
itself. In the language dialog, each element in the list
except for the last will be a nested turn down triangle on
the left of the dialog. The final entry will be the name
that the user can choose to select this language. Names that
are the same will be combined into the same turndown entry.

For example, if one language's position is:
@schemeblock[
(list "General Category" "Specific Category" "My Language")
]
and another's is:
@schemeblock[
(list "General Category" "Specific Category" "My Other Language")

saved by DrScheme, and removed from the buffer after it is

The result of this method is used when saving or loading files.

If the result is a sexp, saved files get a prefix inserted
at the beginning (the prefix is determined by calling
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-metadata]). When the file is then loaded, DrScheme recognizes this
prefix and sets the language back to match the saved file.

See also
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> metadata->settings],
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines], and
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-metadata].


}

@defmethod[(get-style-delta)
           (or/c #f (is-a?/c style-delta%) (listof (list/c (is-a?/c style-delta%) number? number?)))]{
The style delta that this method returns is used in the
language dialog and the DrScheme REPL when the language's
name is printed.

When it is @scheme[#f], no styling is used.

If the result is a list, each element is expected to be a
list of three items, a style-delta, and two numbers. The
style delta will be applied to the corresponding portion of
the name.

@defmethod[(marshall-settings [settings settings])
           writable]{
Translates an instance of the settings type into a scheme
object that can be written out to disk.

}

@defmethod[(metadata->settings [metadata string?])
           settings]{

This method is only called when
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-reader-module] returns an sexp.

When a file is opened in DrScheme, if this language's
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-reader-module] returns an sexp, the prefix of the file
(the first N lines, where N is the number
returned by 
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-metadata-lines]) is scanned for @scheme["#reader"] followed by the
result of
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> get-reader-module]. If that pattern is found, the language is set to this language.
Also, the entire prefix is passed, as a string,
to this method which returns a @scheme[settings] value, used as
the settings for this language.

@defmethod[(on-execute [settings settings]
                       [run-in-user-thread ((-> any) -> any)])
           any]{
The @scheme[on-execute] method is called on DrScheme's
eventspace's main thread before any evaluation happens
when the Run button is clicked. It is also called when
a new DrScheme tab (or window) is created to initialize
the empty interactions window.

Use this method to initialize MzScheme's
@secref[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl") "parameters"]
for the user. When
this function is called, the user's thread has already been
created, as has its custodian. These parameters have been
changed from the defaults in MzScheme:
@itemize[
@item{@scheme[current-custodian] is set to a new custodian.}
@item{@scheme[current-namespace] has been set to a newly
  created empty namespace.This namespace has the following modules 
  copied (with @scheme[namespace-attach-module])
  from DrScheme's original namespace:
  @itemize[
  @item{@scheme['mzscheme]}
  @item{@scheme['(lib "mred.ss" "mred")]}
  ]}
@item{
  @scheme[read-curly-brace-as-paren]
  is @scheme[#t],}
@item{
  @scheme[read-square-bracket-as-paren]
  is @scheme[#t],}
@item{The 
  @scheme[port-write-handler]
  and
  @scheme[port-display-handler]
  have been set to procedures
  that call 
  @scheme[pretty-print]
  and 
  @scheme[pretty-display] instead
  of 
  @scheme[write] and 
  @scheme[display].  When
  @scheme[pretty-print] and 
  @scheme[pretty-display] are
  called by these parameters, the
  @scheme[pretty-print-columns] parameter is set to
  @scheme['infinity], so the output looks just like
  @scheme[write] and 
  @scheme[display]. This is done so that
  special scheme values can be displayed as snips.}
@item{The
  @scheme[current-print-covert-hook] is to a
  procedure so that @scheme[snip%]s are just returned
  directly to be inserted into the interactions
  @scheme[text%] object.} 
@item{The output and input ports are set to point to the
  interactions window with these parameters:
  @scheme[current-input-port],
  @scheme[current-output-port], and
  @scheme[current-error-port].}
@item{The
@scheme[event-dispatch-handler]   is set so that DrScheme can perform some initial setup and
  close down around the user's code.}
@item{The
  @scheme[current-directory] and
  @scheme[current-load-relative-directory]
  are set to the directory where the definitions file is
  saved, or if it isn't saved, to the initial directory where
  DrScheme started up.}
@item{The snip-class-list, returned by
@scheme[get-the-snip-class-list] is initialized with all of the snipclasses in DrScheme's eventspace's snip-class-list.}

@item{
The 
@scheme[error-print-source-location]
parameter is set to @scheme[#f] and the 
@scheme[error-display-handler]
is set to a handler that creates an error message from the
exception record, with font and color information and inserts
that error message into the definitions window.}

]

The @scheme[run-in-user-thread] arguments accepts thunks and
runs them on the user's eventspace's main thread. These
thunks must not raise an exceptions (or drscheme itself will
get stuck). In addition, the output ports are not yet
functioning, so print outs should be directed to the
original drscheme output port, if necessary.

@defmethod[(order-manuals [manuals (listof bytes?)])
           (values (listof bytes?) boolean?)]{
Returns a sublist of its input, that specifies the manuals
(and their order) to search in. The boolean result indicates
if doc.txt files should be searched.

           void?]{
This method is just like
@method[drscheme:language:language<%> render-value/format] except that it is expected to put the entire value on a
single line with no newline after the value.

@defmethod[(render-value/format [value TST]

                                [width (or/c number (symbols 'infinity))])
           void?]{
This method is used to print values into a port, for display
to a user. The final argument is a maximum width to use (in
characters) when formatting the value.

This method is expected to format the value by inserting
newlines in appropriate places and is expected to render a
newline after the value.

@method[drscheme:language:language<%> render-value].

@defmethod[(unmarshall-settings [input writable])
           (or/c settings false/c)]{
Translates a Scheme value into a settings, returning
@scheme[#f] if that is not possible.
