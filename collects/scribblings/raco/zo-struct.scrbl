@defmodule[compiler/zo-structs]

The @racketmodname[compiler/zo-structs] library defines the bytecode
structures that are produced by @racket[zo-parse] and consumed by
@racket[decompile] and @racket[zo-marshal].

@defstruct+[zo ()]{
  A supertype for all forms that can appear in compiled code.}

  Wraps compiled code.  The @racket[max-let-depth] field indicates the
  maximum stack depth that @racket[code] creates (not counting the

  The @racket[phase] indicates the phase level of the definition within
  its module. The @racket[constantness] field is either @racket['constant],
  a @racket[function-shape] value, or a @racket[struct-shape] value
  to indicate that
  variable's value is always the same for every instantiation of its module;
  @racket['fixed] to indicate

  @racket[forms] forms has its own @racket[prefix], which is pushed before evaluating
  @racket[rhs] or the @racket[forms]; the stack is restored after obtaining the result values.
  The @racket[max-let-depth] field indicates the maximum size of the
  stack that will be created by @racket[rhs] (not counting
  @racket[prefix]).  The @racket[dummy] variable is used to access the enclosing 
  namespace.}

@defstruct+[(req form) ([reqs stx?]

             [pre-submodules (listof mod?)]
             [post-submodules (listof mod?)])]{
  Represents a @racket[module] declaration.

  The @racket[provides] and @racket[requires] lists are each an
  association list from phases to exports or imports.  In the case of
  @racket[provides], each phase maps to two lists: one for exported
  variables, and another for exported syntax.  In the case of
  @racket[requires], each phase maps to a list of imported module paths.

  The @racket[body] field contains the module's run-time (i.e., phase
  0) code. The @racket[syntax-bodies] list has a list of forms for
  each higher phase in the module body; the phases are in order
  starting with phase 1.  The @racket[body] forms use @racket[prefix],
  rather than any prefix in place for the module declaration itself,
  while members of lists in @racket[syntax-bodies] have their own
  prefixes. After each form in @racket[body] or @racket[syntax-bodies]
  is evaluated, the stack is restored to its depth from before
  evaluating the form.

  The @racket[unexported] list contains lists of symbols for
  unexported definitions that can be accessed through macro expansion
  and that are implemented through the forms in @racket[body] and
  @racket[syntax-bodies].  Each list in @racket[unexported] starts
  with a phase level.

  The @racket[max-let-depth] field indicates the maximum stack depth
  created by @racket[body] forms (not counting the @racket[prefix]
  array).  The @racket[dummy] variable is used to access to the
  top-level namespace.

  The @racket[lang-info] value specifies an optional module path that
  provides information about the module's implementation language.

  The @racket[internal-module-context] value describes the lexical
  context of the body of the module.  This value is used by
  @racket[module->namespace].  A @racket[#f] value means that the
  context is unavailable or empty.  A @racket[#t] value means that the
  context is computed by re-importing all required modules.  A
  syntax-object value embeds an arbitrary lexical context.

  The @racket[flags] field records certain properties of the module.
  The @racket['cross-phase] flag indicates that the module body is
  evaluated once and the results shared across instances for all phases; such a
  module contains only definitions of functions, structure types, and
  structure type properties.

  The @racket[pre-submodules] field records @racket[module]-declared
  submodules, while the @racket[post-submodules] field records
  @racket[module*]-declared submodules.}

@section{Expressions}

@defstruct+[(expr form) ()]{
  A supertype for all expression forms that can appear in compiled code,
  except for literals that are represented as themselves and some
  @racket[seq] structures (which can appear as an expression as long as
  it contains only other things that can be expressions).}

             [toplevel-map (or/c #f (set/c exact-nonnegative-integer?))]
             [max-let-depth exact-nonnegative-integer?]
             [body (or/c expr? seq? any/c)])]{
  Represents a @racket[lambda] form.  The @racket[name] field is a name
  for debugging purposes.  The @racket[num-params] field indicates the
  number of arguments accepted by the procedure, not counting a rest
  argument; the @racket[rest?] field indicates whether extra arguments
  are accepted and collected into a ``rest'' variable.  The
  @racket[param-types] list contains @racket[num-params] symbols
  indicating the type of each argumet, either @racket['val] for a normal
  argument, @racket['ref] for a boxed argument (representing a mutable
  local variable), or @racket['flonum] for a flonum argument. 

  The
  @racket[closure-map] field is a vector of stack positions that are
  captured when evaluating the @racket[lambda] form to create a closure.
  The @racket[closure-types] field provides a corresponding list of
  types, but no distinction is made between normal values and boxed
  values; also, this information is redundant, since it can be inferred
  by the bindings referenced though @racket[closure-map].

  Which a closure captures top-level or module-level variables, they
  are represented in the closure by capturing a prefix (in the sense
  of @racket[prefix]).  The @racket[toplevel-map] field indicates
  which top-level and lifted variables are actually used by the
  closure (so that variables in a prefix can be pruned by the run-time
  system if they become unused). A @racket[#f] value indicates either
  that no prefix is captured or all variables in the prefix should be
  considered used. Otherwise, numbers in the set indicate which
  variables and lifted variables are used. Variables are numbered
  consecutively by position in the prefix starting from
  @racket[0]. Lifted variables are numbered immediately
  afterward---which means that, if the prefix contains any syntax
  objects, lifted-variable numbers are shifted down relative to a
  @racket[toplevel] by the number of syntax object in the prefix plus
  one (which makes the @racket[toplevel-map] set more compact).

  When the function is called, the rest-argument list (if any) is pushed
  onto the stack, then the normal arguments in reverse order, then the
  closure-captured values in reverse order.  Thus, when @racket[body] is
  run, the first value on the stack is the first value captured by the
  @racket[closure-map] array, and so on.

  The @racket[max-let-depth] field indicates the maximum stack depth
  created by @racket[body] plus the arguments and closure-captured
  values pushed onto the stack.  The @racket[body] field is the
  expression for the closure's body.}

@defstruct+[(closure expr)
            ([code lam?] [gen-id symbol?])]{
  A @racket[lambda] form with an empty closure, which is a procedure
  constant.  The procedure constant can appear multiple times in the
  graph of expressions for bytecode, and the @racket[code] field can be
  a cycle for a recursive constant procedure; the @racket[gen-id] is
  different for each such constant.}

@defstruct+[(case-lam expr) ([name (or/c symbol? vector?)]
                             [clauses (listof lam?)])]{

  @racket[lambda] forms that are tried (in order) based on the number of
  arguments given.}

  and puts its value into the slot, and then runs @racket[body].  If
  @racket[type] is not @racket[#f], then @racket[rhs] must produce a
  value of the corresponding type, and the slot must be accessed by @racket[localref]s that
  expect the type.  If @racket[unused?] is @racket[#t], then the slot
  must not be used, and the value of @racket[rhs] is not actually pushed
  onto the stack (but @racket[rhs] is constrained to produce a single
  value).

  After @racket[rhs] is evaluated, the stack is restored to its depth

  Runs @racket[rhs] to obtain @racket[count] results, and installs them
  into existing slots on the stack in order, skipping the first
  @racket[pos] stack positions. If @racket[boxes?] is @racket[#t], then
  the values are put into existing boxes in the stack slots.

@defstruct+[(let-rec expr) ([procs (listof lam?)]
                            [body (or/c expr? seq? any/c)])]{
  Represents a @racket[letrec] form with @racket[lambda] bindings.  It
  allocates a closure shell for each @racket[lambda] form in
  @racket[procs], installs each onto the stack in previously allocated
  slots in reverse order (so that the closure shell for the last element
  of @racket[procs] is installed at stack position @racket[0]), fills
  out each shell's closure (where each closure normally references some
  other just-created closures, which is possible because the shells have
  been installed on the stack), and then evaluates @racket[body].}

@defstruct+[(boxenv expr)
            ([pos exact-nonnegative-integer?]
             [body (or/c expr? seq? any/c)])]{
  Skips @racket[pos] elements of the stack, setting the slot afterward
  to a new box containing the slot's old value, and then runs
  @racket[body]. This form appears when a @racket[lambda] argument is
  mutated using @racket[set!] within its body; calling the function
  initially pushes the value directly on the stack, and this form boxes
  the value so that it can be mutated later.}

  Represents a local-variable reference; it accesses the value in the
  stack slot after the first @racket[pos] slots.  If @racket[unbox?]  is
  @racket[#t], the stack slot contains a box, and a value is extracted
  from the box.  If @racket[clear?] is @racket[#t], then after the value
  is obtained, the stack slot is cleared (to avoid retaining a reference
  that can prevent reclamation of the value as garbage).  If
  @racket[other-clears?] is @racket[#t], then some later reference to
  the same stack slot may clear after reading.  If @racket[type] is
  not @racket[#f], the slot is known to hold a specific type of value.}

  Represents a reference to a top-level or imported variable via the
  @racket[prefix] array. The @racket[depth] field indicates the number
  of stack slots to skip to reach the prefix array, and @racket[pos] is
  the offset into the array.

  When the @racket[toplevel] is an expression, if both @racket[const?]
  and @racket[ready?] are @racket[#t], then the variable definitely
  will be defined, its value stays constant, and the constant is
  effectively the same for every module instantiation. If only
  @racket[const?] is @racket[#t], then the value is constant, but it
  may vary across instantiations. If only @racket[ready?] is
  @racket[#t], then the variable definitely will be defined, but its
  value may change. If @racket[const?] and @racket[ready?] are both
  @racket[#f], then a check is needed to determine whether the
  variable is defined.

  When the @racket[toplevel] is the right-hand side for
  @racket[def-values], then @racket[const?]  is @racket[#f]. If
  @racket[ready?] is @racket[#t], the variable is marked as immutable
