@title[#:tag "make"]{@exec{raco make}: Compiling Source to Bytecode}

The @exec{raco make} command accept filenames for Racket modules to be
compiled to bytecode format. Modules are re-compiled only if the
source Racket file is newer than the bytecode file and has a different
SHA-1 hash, or if any imported module is recompiled or has a different
SHA-1 hash for its compiled form plus dependencies.

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@section{Bytecode Files}

A file @filepath{@nonterm{name}.@nonterm{ext}} is compiled to bytecode
that is saved as @filepath{compiled/@nonterm{name}_@nonterm{ext}.zo}
relative to the file. As a result, the bytecode file is normally used
automatically when @filepath{@nonterm{name}.@nonterm{ext}} is required
as a module, since the underlying @racket[load/use-compiled] operation
detects such a bytecode file.

For example, in a directory that contains the following files:

@itemize[

 @item{@filepath{a.rkt}:

@racketmod[
racket
(require "b.rkt" "c.rkt")
(+ b c)
]}

 @item{@filepath{b.rkt}:

@racketmod[
racket
(provide b)
(define b 1)
]}

 @item{@filepath{c.rkt}:

@racketmod[
racket
(provide c)
(define c 1)
]}]

then

@commandline{raco make a.rkt}

triggers the creation of @filepath{compiled/a_rkt.zo},
@filepath{compiled/b_rkt.zo}, and @filepath{compiled/c_rkt.zo}.
A subsequent

@commandline{racket a.rkt}

loads bytecode from the generated @filepath{.zo} files, paying
attention to the @filepath{.rkt} sources only to confirm that each
@filepath{.zo} file has a later timestamp.

In contrast,

@commandline{racket b.rkt c.rkt}

would create only @filepath{compiled/b_rkt.zo} and
@filepath{compiled/c_rkt.zo}, since neither @filepath{b.rkt} nor
@filepath{c.rkt} imports @filepath{a.rkt}.

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@section{Dependency Files}

In addition to a bytecode file, @exec{raco make} creates a file
@filepath{compiled/@nonterm{name}_@nonterm{ext}.dep} that records
dependencies of the compiled module on other module files and the
source file's SHA-1 hash.  Using this dependency information, a
re-compilation request via @exec{raco make} can consult both the
source file's timestamp/hash and the timestamps/hashes for the
bytecode of imported modules.  Furthermore, imported modules are
themselves compiled as necessary, including updating the bytecode and
dependency files for the imported modules, transitively.

Continuing the @exec{raco make a.rkt} example from the previous
section, the @exec{raco make} command creates
@filepath{compiled/a_rkt.dep}, @filepath{compiled/b_rkt.dep}, and
@filepath{compiled/c_rkt.dep} at the same time as the @filepath{.zo}
files. The @filepath{compiled/a_rkt.dep} file records the dependency
of @filepath{a.rkt} on @filepath{b.rkt}, @filepath{c.rkt} and the
@racketmodname[racket] library. If the @filepath{b.rkt} file is
modified (so that its timestamp and SHA-1 hash changes), then running

@commandline{raco make a.rkt}

again rebuilds @filepath{compiled/a_rkt.zo} and
@filepath{compiled/b_rkt.zo}.

For module files that are within library collections, @exec{raco
setup} uses the same @filepath{.zo} and @filepath{.dep} conventions
and files as @exec{raco make}, so the two tools can be used together.

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@section{API for Making Bytecode}

@defmodule[compiler/cm]{The @racketmodname[compiler/cm] module
implements the compilation and dependency management used by
@exec{raco make} and @exec{raco setup}.}

@defproc[(make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler)
         (path? (or/c symbol? false/c) . -> . any)]{

Returns a procedure suitable as a value for the
@racket[current-load/use-compiled] parameter. The returned procedure
passes it arguments on to the @racket[current-load/use-compiled]
procedure that is installed when
@racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler] is called,
but first it automatically compiles a source file to a @filepath{.zo}
file if

@itemize[

 @item{the file is expected to contain a module (i.e., the second
 argument to the handler is a symbol);}

 @item{the value of each of @racket[(current-eval)],
 @racket[(current-load)], and @racket[(namespace-module-registry
 (current-namespace))] is the same as when
 @racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler] was
 called;}

 @item{the value of @racket[use-compiled-file-paths] contains the
 first path that was present when
 @racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler] was
 called;}

 @item{the value of @racket[current-load/use-compiled] is the result
 of this procedure; and}

 @item{one of the following holds:

 @itemize[

  @item{the source file is newer than the @filepath{.zo} file in the
        first sub-directory listed in @racket[use-compiled-file-paths]
        (at the time that
        @racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler]
        was called), and either no @filepath{.dep} file exists or it
        records a source-file SHA-1 hash that differs from the current
        version and source-file SHA-1 hash;}

  @item{no @filepath{.dep} file exists next to the @filepath{.zo}
        file;}

  @item{the version recorded in the @filepath{.dep} file does not
        match the result of @racket[(version)];}

  @item{one of the files listed in the @filepath{.dep} file has a
        @filepath{.zo} timestamp newer than the target @filepath{.zo},
        and the combined hashes of the dependencies recorded in the
        @filepath{.dep} file does not match the combined hash recorded
        in the @filepath{.dep} file.}

  ]}

]

If SHA-1 hashes override a timestamp-based decision to recompile the
file, then the target @filepath{.zo} file's timestamp is updated to
the current time.

After the handler procedure compiles a @filepath{.zo} file, it creates
a corresponding @filepath{.dep} file that lists the current version
and the identification of every file that is directly
@racket[require]d by the module in the compiled file. Additional
dependencies can be installed during compilation via
@racketmodname[compiler/cm-accomplice]. The @filepath{.dep} file also
records the SHA-1 hash of the module's source, and it records a
combined SHA-1 hash of all of the dependencies that includes their
recursive dependencies.

The handler caches timestamps when it checks @filepath{.dep} files,
and the cache is maintained across calls to the same handler. The
cache is not consulted to compare the immediate source file to its
@filepath{.zo} file, which means that the caching behavior is
consistent with the caching of the default module name resolver (see
@racket[current-module-name-resolver]).

If @racket[use-compiled-file-paths] contains an empty list when
@racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler] is called,
then @racket[exn:fail:contract] exception is raised.

@emph{Do not} install the result of
@racket[make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler] when the
current namespace contains already-loaded versions of modules that may
need to be recompiled---unless the already-loaded modules are never
referenced by not-yet-loaded modules. References to already-loaded
modules may produce compiled files with inconsistent timestamps and/or
@filepath{.dep} files with incorrect information.}


@defproc[(managed-compile-zo [file path-string?]
                             [read-src-syntax (any/c input-port? . -> . syntax?) read-syntax]) 
         void?]{

Compiles the given module source file to a @filepath{.zo}, installing
a compilation-manager handler while the file is compiled (so that
required modules are also compiled), and creating a @filepath{.dep} file
to record the timestamps of immediate files used to compile the source
(i.e., files @racket[require]d in the source).

If @racket[file] is compiled from source, then
@racket[read-src-syntax] is used in the same way as
@racket[read-syntax] to read the source module. The normal
@racket[read-syntax] is used for any required files, however.}


@defboolparam[trust-existing-zos trust?]{

A parameter that is intended for use by @exec{setup-plt} when
installing with pre-built @filepath{.zo} files. It causes a
compilation-manager @racket[load/use-compiled] handler to ``touch''
out-of-date @filepath{.zo} files instead of re-compiling from source.}


@defproc[(make-caching-managed-compile-zo
          [read-src-syntax (any/c input-port? . -> . syntax?)])
         (path-string? . -> . void?)]{

Returns a procedure that behaves like @racket[managed-compile-zo]
(providing the same @racket[read-src-syntax] each time), but a cache
of timestamp information is preserved across calls to the procedure.}


@defparam[manager-compile-notify-handler notify (path? . -> . any)]{

A parameter for a procedure of one argument that is called whenever a
compilation starts. The argument to the procedure is the file's path.}


@defparam[manager-trace-handler notify (string? . -> . any)]{

A parameter for a procedure of one argument that is called to report
 compilation-manager actions, such as checking a file. The argument to
 the procedure is a string.}

@defparam[manager-skip-file-handler proc (-> path? (or/c (cons/c number? promise?) #f))]{

A parameter whose value is called for each file that is loaded and
 needs recompilation. If the procedure returns a pair, then the file
 is skipped (i.e., not compiled); the number in the pair is used as
 the timestamp for the file's bytecode, and the promise may be
 @racket[force]d to obtain a string that is used as hash of the
 compiled file plus its dependencies. If the procedure returns
 @racket[#f], then the file is compiled as usual. The default is
 @racket[(lambda (x) #f)].}

@defproc[(file-stamp-in-collection [p path?]) (or/c (cons/c number? promise?) #f)]{
  Calls @racket[file-stamp-in-paths] with @racket[p] and
  @racket[(current-library-collection-paths)].}

@defproc[(file-stamp-in-paths [p path?] [paths (listof path?)]) (or/c (cons/c number? promise?) #f)]{

Returns the file-modification date and @racket[delay]ed hash of
 @racket[p]or its bytecode form (i.e., @filepath{.zo} file), whichever
 exists and is newer, if @racket[p] is an extension of any path in
 @racket[paths] (i.e., exists in the directory, a subdirectory,
 etc.). Otherwise, the result is @racket[#f].

 This function is intended for use with @racket[manager-skip-file-handler].}


@defproc[(get-file-sha1 [p path?]) (or/c string? #f)]{

Computes a SHA-1 hash for the file @racket[p]; the result is
@racket[#f] if @racket[p] cannot be opened.}


@defproc[(get-compiled-file-sha1 [p path?]) (or/c string? #f)]{

Computes a SHA-1 hash for the bytecode file @racket[p], appending any
dependency-describing hash available from a @filepath{.dep} file when
available (i.e., the suffix on @racket[p] is replaced by
@filepath{.dep} to locate dependency information). The result is
@racket[#f] if @racket[p] cannot be opened.}

@section{Compilation Manager Hook for Syntax Transformers}

@defmodule[compiler/cm-accomplice]

@defproc[(register-external-file [file (and path? complete-path?)]) void?]{

Logs a message (see @racket[log-message]) at level @racket['info]. The
message data is a @racketidfont{file-dependency} prefab structure type
with one field whose value is @racket[file].

A compilation manager implemented by @racketmodname[compiler/cm] looks
for such messages to register an external dependency. The compilation
manager records (in a @filepath{.dep} file) the path as contributing
to the implementation of the module currently being
compiled. Afterward, if the registered file is modified, the
compilation manager will know to recompile the module.

The @racket[include] macro, for example, calls this procedure with the
path of an included file as it expands an @racket[include] form.}

@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "zo"]{Compiling to Raw Bytecode}

The @DFlag{zo}/@Flag{z} mode for @exec{raco make} is an improverished
form of the compilation, because it does not track import
dependencies. It does, however, support compilation of non-module
source.

By default, the generated bytecode is placed in the same directory as
the source file---which is not where it will be found automatically
when loading the source. Use the @as-index{@DFlag{auto-dir}} flag to
redirect the output to a @filepath{compiled} subdirectory, where it
will be found automatically when loading the source file.

Outside of a module, top-level @racket[define-syntaxes],
@racket[module], @racket[#%require],
@racket[define-values-for-syntax], and and @racket[begin] expressions
are handled specially by @exec{raco make --zo}: the compile-time
portion of the expression is evaluated, because it might affect later
expressions. (The @Flag{m} or @DFlag{module} flag turns off this
special handling.)

For example, when compiling the file containing

@racketblock[
(require racket/class)
(define f (class% object% (super-new)))
]

the @racket[class] form from the @racketmodname[racket/class] library
must be bound in the compilation namespace at compile time. Thus, the
@racket[require] expression is both compiled (to appear in the output
code) and evaluated (for further computation).

Many definition forms expand to @racket[define-syntaxes]. For example,
@racket[define-signature] expands to @racket[define-syntaxes]. In
@racket[--zo] mode, @exec{raco make --zo} detects
@racket[define-syntaxes] and other expressions after expansion, so
top-level @racket[define-signature] expressions affect the compilation
of later expressions, as a programmer would expect.

In contrast, a @racket[load] or @racket[eval] expression in a source
file is compiled---but @emph{not evaluated!}---as the source file is
compiled.  Even if the @racket[load] expression loads syntax or
signature definitions, these will not be loaded as the file is
compiled. The same is true of application expressions that affect the
reader, such as @racket[(read-case-sensitive #t)]. The @Flag{p} or
@DFlag{prefix} flag for @exec{raco make} takes a file and loads it before
compiling the source files specified on the command line.

In general, a better solution is to put all code to compile into a
module and use @exec{raco make} in its default mode.
