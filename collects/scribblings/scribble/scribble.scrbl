@title{@bold{Scribble}: PLT Documentation Tool}

@author["Matthew Flatt" "Eli Barzilay"]

Scribble is a collection of tools for creating prose documents,
especially those that document libraries, and especially for HTML and
PDF (via LaTeX) output.  More generally, it is useful for cases where
you need to deal with Scheme code that is rich in textual content: it
has a syntactic extension for writing almost free-form text and a tool
for using the scribble syntax for preprocessing text files.

This document itself is written using Scribble. At the time that it
was written, its source was available at
@(let ([url "http://svn.plt-scheme.org/plt/trunk/collects/scribblings/scribble/"])
   (link url url))
starting with the @filepath{scribble.scrbl} file.
