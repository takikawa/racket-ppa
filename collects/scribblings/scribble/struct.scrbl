@title[#:tag "struct"]{Structures And Processing}

@defmodule[scribble/struct]

A document is represented as a @techlink{part}, as described in
 @secref["parts"]. This representation is intended to
 independent of its eventual rendering, and it is intended to be
 immutable; rendering extensions and specific data in a document can
 collude arbitrarily, however.

A document is processed in three passes. The first pass is the
 @deftech{collect pass}, which globally collects information in the
 document, such as targets for hyperlinking. The second pass is the
 @deftech{resolve pass}, which matches hyperlink references with
 targets and expands delayed elements (where the expansion should not
 contribute new hyperlink targets). The final pass is the
 @deftech{render pass}, which generates the resulting document. None
 of the passes mutate the document, but instead collect information in
 side @scheme[collect-info] and @scheme[resolve-info] tables.

@section[#:tag "parts"]{Parts}

A @deftech{part} is an instance of @scheme[part]; among other things,
 it has a title @techlink{content}, an initial @techlink{flow}, and a
 list of subsection @techlink{parts}. An @scheme[unnumbered-part] is
 the same as a @scheme[part], but it isn't numbered. A
 @scheme[versioned-part] is add a version field to
 @scheme[part]. There's no difference between a part and a full
 document; a particular source module just as easily defines a
 subsection (incorporated via @scheme[include-section]) as a document.

A @deftech{flow} is an instance of @scheme[flow]; it has a list of
 @techlink{blocks}.

A @deftech{block} is either a @techlink{table}, an
 @techlink{itemization}, @techlink{blockquote}, @techlink{paragraph},
 or a @techlink{delayed block}.

@itemize{

       @item{A @deftech{table} is an instance of @scheme[table]; it
             has a list of list of @techlink{flows} with a particular
             style. In Latex output, each table cell is typeset as a
             single line.}

       @item{A @deftech{itemization} is an instance of @scheme[itemization];
             it has a list of @techlink{flows}.}

       @item{A @deftech{blockquote} is an instance of
             @scheme[blockquote]; it has list of @tech{blocks}
             that are indented according to a specified style.}

       @item{A @deftech{paragraph} is an instance of
             @scheme[paragraph]; it has a @deftech{content}, which is
             a list of @techlink{elements}:

             @itemize{

             @item{An @deftech{element} can be a string, one of a few
                   symbols, an instance of @scheme[element] (possibly

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "tags"]{Tags}

A @deftech{tag} is a list containing a symbol and either a string, a
@scheme[generated-tag] instance, or an arbitrary list. The symbol
effectively identifies the type of the tag, such as @scheme['part] for
a tag that links to a part, or @scheme['def] for a Scheme function
definition. The symbol also effectively determines the interpretation
of the second half of the tag.

A part can have a @deftech{tag prefix}, which is effectively added
onto the second item within each tag whose first item is
@scheme['part] or @scheme['tech]. The prefix is added to a string
value by creating a list containing the prefix and string, and it is
added to a list value using @scheme[cons]; a prefix is not added to a
@scheme[generated-tag] instance. The prefix is used for reference
outside the part, including the use of tags in the part's
@scheme[tags] field. Typically, a document's main part has a tag
prefix that applies to the whole document; references to sections and
defined terms within the document from other documents must include,
while references within the same document omit the prefix. Part
prefixes can be used within a document as well, to help disambiguate
references within the document.

Some procedures accept a ``tag'' that is just the string part of the
full tag, where the symbol part is supplied automatically. For
example, @scheme[section] and @scheme[secref] both accept a string
``tag'', where @scheme['part] is implicit.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section[#:tag "passes"]{Collected and Resolved Information}

The @techlink{collect pass}, @techlink{resolve pass}, and
@techlink{render pass} processing steps all produce information that
is specific to a rendering mode. Concretely, the operations are all
represented as methods on a @scheme[render%] object.

The result of the @method[render% collect] method is a
@scheme[collect-info] instance. This result is provided back as an
argument to the @method[render% resolve] method, which produces a
@scheme[resolve-info] value that encapsulates the results from both
iterations. The @scheme[resolve-info] value is provided back to the
@method[render% resolve] method for final rendering.

Optionally, before the @method[render% resolve] method is called,
serialized information from other documents can be folded into the
@scheme[collect-info] instance via the @method[render%
deserialize-info] method. Other methods provide serialized information
out of the collected and resolved records.

During the @techlink{collect pass}, the procedure associated with a
@scheme[collect-element] instance can register information with
@scheme[collect-put!].

During the @techlink{resolve pass}, collected information for a part
can be extracted with @scheme[part-collected-info], which includes a
part's number and its parent part (or @scheme[#f]). More generally,
the @scheme[resolve-get] method looks up information previously
collected. This resolve-time information is normally obtained by the
procedure associated with a @techlink{delayed block} or
@techlink{delayed element}.

The @scheme[resolve-get] information accepts both a @scheme[part] and
a @scheme[resolve-info] argument. The @scheme[part] argument enables
searching for information in each enclosing part before sibling parts.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

@section{Structure Reference}

@defstruct[part ([tag-prefix (or/c false/c string?)]
                 [tags (listof tag?)]
                 [title-content (or/c false/c list?)]
                 [style any/c]
                 [to-collect list?]
                 [flow flow?]
                 [parts (listof part?)])]{

The @scheme[tag-prefix] field determines the optional @techlink{tag
prefix} for the part.

The @scheme[tags] indicates a list of @techlink{tags} that each link
to the section.

The @scheme[title-content] field holds the part's title, if any.

The @scheme[style] field is normally either a symbol or a list of
symbols.  The currently recognized style symbols (alone or in a list)
are as follows:

@itemize{

 @item{@scheme['toc] --- sub-parts of the part are rendered on separate
       pages for multi-page HTML mode.}

 @item{@scheme['index] --- the part represents an index.}

 @item{@scheme['reveal] --- shows sub-parts when this part is
       displayed in a table-of-contents panel in HTML output (which
       normally shows only the top-level sections).}

 @item{@scheme['hidden] --- the part title is not shown in rendered output.}

 @item{@scheme['no-toc] --- as a style for the main part of a
       document, causes the HTML output to not include a margin box
       for the main table of contents; the ``on this page'' box that
       contains @scheme[toc-element] and @scheme[toc-target-element]
       links (and that only includes an ``on this page'' label for
       multi-page documents) takes on the location and color of the
       main table of contents, instead.}

}

The @scheme[to-collect] field contains @techlink{content} that is
inspected during the @techlink{collect pass}, but ignored in later
passes (i.e., it doesn't directly contribute to the output).

The @scheme[flow] field contains the part's initial flow (before
sub-parts).

The @scheme[parts] field contains sub-parts.

}


@defstruct[(unnumbered-part part) ()]{

Although a section number is computed for an ``unnumbered'' section
during the @techlink{collect pass}, the number is not rendered.

}


@defstruct[(versioned-part part) ([version (or/c string? false/c)])]{

Supplies a version number for this part and its sub-parts (except as
overridden). A @scheme[#f] version is the same as not supplying a
version.

The version number may be used when rendering a document. At a
minimum, a version is rendered when it is attached to a part
representing the whole document. The default version for a document is
@scheme[(version)].}


@defstruct[flow ([paragraphs (listof flow-element?)])]{

A @techlink{flow} has a list of @tech{blocks}.

}

@defstruct[paragraph ([content list?])]{

A @techlink{paragraph} has a list of @tech{elements}.

}

@defstruct[(styled-paragraph paragraph) ([style any/c])]{

The @scheme[style] is normally a string that corresponds to a CSS
class for HTML output.

}


@defstruct[table ([style any/c]
                  [flowss (listof (listof (or/c flow? (one-of/c 'cont))))])]{

A @techlink{table} has, roughly, a list of list of flows. A cell in
the table can span multiple columns by using @scheme['cont] instead of
a flow in the following columns (i.e., for all but the first in a set
of cells that contain a single flow).

}


@defstruct[itemization ([flows (listof flow?)])]{

A @techlink{itemization} has a list of flows.

}

@defstruct[blockquote ([style any/c]
                       [paragraphs (listof flow-element?)])]{

A @techlink{blockquote} has a style and a list of @tech{blocks}.  The
@scheme[style] field is normally a string that corresponds to a CSS
class for HTML output.

}

@defstruct[delayed-block ([resolve (any/c part? resolve-info? . -> . flow-element?)])]{

The @scheme[resolve] procedure is called during the @techlink{resolve
pass} to obtain a normal @tech{block}. The first argument to
@scheme[resolve] is the renderer.

}


@defstruct[element ([style any/c]
                    [content list?])]{

The @scheme[style] field is normally either

@itemize{

 @item{a string, which corresponds to a CSS class for HTML output and
       a macro name for Latex output;}

 @item{one of the symbols that all renderers recognize: @scheme['tt],
       @scheme['italic], @scheme['bold], @scheme['sf],
       @scheme['subscript], @scheme['superscript], @scheme['hspace],
       or @scheme['newline] (which renders a line break independent of
       the @scheme[content]);}

 @item{a list of the form @scheme[(list 'color _name)] or
       @scheme[(list 'color _byte _byte _byte)] to set the text color,
       where @scheme[_name] is one of @scheme["white"],
       @scheme["black"], @scheme["red"], @scheme["green"],
       @scheme["blue"], @scheme["cyan"], @scheme["magenta"], or
       @scheme["yellow"], or three @scheme[_byte]s specify RGB
       values;}

 @item{a list of the form @scheme[(list 'bg-color _name)] or
       @scheme[(list 'bg-color _byte _byte _byte)] to set the text
       background color (with the same constraints and meanings as for
       @scheme['color]);}

 @item{an instance of @scheme[target-url] to generate a hyperlink;}

 @item{an instance of @scheme[image-file] to support an inline image; or}

 @item{an instance of @scheme[with-attributes], which combines a base
       style with a set of additional HTML attributes.}

}

The @scheme[content] field is a list of @techlink{elements}.

}


@defstruct[(target-element element) ([tag tag?])]{

Declares the content as a hyperlink target for @scheme[tag].

}


@defstruct[(toc-target-element target-element) ()]{

Like @scheme[target-element], the content is also a kind of section
label to be shown in the ``on this page'' table for HTML output.

}


@defstruct[(toc-element element) ([toc-content list?])]{

Similar to @scheme[toc-target-element], but with specific content for
the ``on this page'' table specified in the @scheme[toc-content]
field.

}


@defstruct[(link-element element) ([tag tag?])]{

Hyperlinks the content to @scheme[tag].

}


@defstruct[(index-element element) ([tag tag?]
                                    [plain-seq (and/c pair? (listof string?))]
                                    [entry-seq list?]
                                    [desc any/c])]{

The @scheme[plain-seq] specifies the keys for sorting, where the first
@tech{element} is the main key, the second is a sub-key, etc. For
example, an ``night'' portion of an index might have sub-entries for
``night, things that go bump in'' and ``night, defender of the''. The
former would be represented by @scheme[plain-seq] @scheme['("night"
"things that go bump in")], and the latter by @scheme['("night"
"defender of the")]. Naturally, single-@tech{element}
@scheme[plain-seq] lists are the common case, and at least one word is
required, but there is no limit to the word-list length. The strings in 
@scheme[plain-seq] must not contain a newline character.

The @scheme[entry-seq] list must have the same length as
@scheme[plain-seq]. It provides the form of each key to render in the
final document.

The @scheme[desc] field provides additional information about the
index entry as supplied by the entry creator. For example, a reference
to a procedure binding can be recognized when @scheme[desc] is an
instance of @scheme[procedure-index-desc]. See
@schememodname[scribble/manual-struct] for other typical types of
@scheme[desc] values.

See also @scheme[index].}


@defstruct[(aux-element element) ()]{

Instances of this structure type are intended for use in titles, where
 the auxiliary part of the title can be omitted in hyperlinks. See,
 for example, @scheme[secref].

}

@defstruct[(hover-element element) ([text string?])]{

The @scheme[text] is displayed in HTML output when the mouse hovers
over the element's content.}


@defstruct[(script-element element) ([type string?]
                                     [script (or/c path-string?
                                                   (listof string?))])]{

For HTML rendering, when scripting is enabled in the browser,
@scheme[script] is used for the element instead of its normal
content---it can be either path naming a script file to refer to, or
the contents of the script. The @scheme[type] string is normally
@scheme["text/javascript"].}


@defstruct[delayed-element ([resolve (any/c part? resolve-info? . -> . list?)]
                            [sizer (-> any/c)]
                            [plain (-> any/c)])]{

The @scheme[render] procedure's arguments are the same as for
@scheme[delayed-block], but the result is @techlink{content} (i.e.,
a list of @techlink{elements}). Unlike @scheme[delayed-block], the
result of the @scheme[render] procedure's argument is remembered on
the first call for re-use for a particular resolve pass.

The @scheme[sizer] field is a procedure that produces a substitute
@techlink{element} for the delayed element for the purposes of
determining the delayed element's width (see @scheme[element-width]).

The @scheme[plain] field is a procedure that produces a substitute
@techlink{element} when needed before the @techlink{collect pass},
such as when @scheme[element->string] is used before the @tech{collect
pass}.

}


@defstruct[part-relative-element ([resolve (collect-info? . -> . list?)]
                                  [sizer (-> any/c)]
                                  [plain (-> any/c)])]{

Similar to @scheme[delayed-block], but the replacement
@techlink{content} is obtained in the @techlink{collect pass} by
calling the function in the @scheme[resolve] field.

The @scheme[resolve] function can call @scheme[collect-info-parents]
to obtain a list of @techlink{parts} that enclose the element,
starting with the nearest enclosing section. Functions like
@scheme[part-collected-info] and @scheme[collected-info-number] can
extract information like the part number.

}


@defstruct[(collect-element element) ([collect (collect-info . -> . any)])]{

Like @scheme[element], but the @scheme[collect] procedure is called
during the @techlink{collect pass}. The @scheme[collect] procedure
normally calls @scheme[collect-put!].

Unlike @scheme[delayed-element] or @scheme[part-relative-element], the
element remains intact (i.e., it is not replaced) by either the
@tech{collect pass} or @tech{resolve pass}.

}

@defstruct[with-attributes ([style any/c]
                            [assoc (listof (cons/c symbol? string?))])]{

Used for an @scheme[element]'s style to combine a base style with
arbitrary HTML attributes.}

Computed for each part by the @techlink{collect pass}.

}


@defstruct[target-url ([addr path-string?]
                       [style any/c])]{

Used as a style for an @scheme[element]. The @scheme[style] at this
layer is a style for the hyperlink.}


@defstruct[image-file ([path (or/c path-string?
                                   (cons/c 'collects (listof bytes?)))]
                       [scale real?])]{

Used as a style for an @scheme[element] to inline an image. The
@scheme[path] field can be a result of
@scheme[path->main-collects-relative].}


@defproc[(block? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @scheme[#t] if @scheme[v] is a @scheme[paragraph],
@scheme[table], @scheme[itemization], @scheme[blockquote], or
@scheme[delayed-block], @scheme[#f] otherwise.

}


@defproc[(tag? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @scheme[#t] if @scheme[v] is acceptable as a link
@techlink{tag}, which is a list containing a symbol and either a
string, a @scheme[generated-tag] instance, or a list (of arbitrary
values).}


@defstruct[generated-tag ()]{

A placeholder for a tag to be generated during the @scheme{collect
 pass}. Use @scheme[tag-key] to convert a tag containing a
 @scheme[generated-tag] instance to one containing a string.

}


@defproc*[([(content->string (content list?)) string?]
           [(content->string (content list?) (renderer any/c) (p part?) (info resolve-info?)) string?])]{

Converts a list of @tech{elements} to a single string (essentially
rendering the content as ``plain text'').

If @scheme[p] and @scheme[info] arguments are not supplied, then a
pre-``collect'' substitute is obtained for @tech{delayed
elements}. Otherwise, the two arguments are used to force the
@tech{delayed element} (if it has not been forced already).}


@defproc*[([(element->string (element any/c)) string?]
           [(element->string (element any/c) (renderer any/c) (p part?) (info resolve-info?)) string?])]{

Like @scheme[content->string], but for a single @tech{element}.

}

@defproc[(element-width (element any/c)) nonnegative-exact-integer?]{

Returns the width in characters of the given @tech{element}.

}


@defproc[(block-width (e block?)) nonnegative-exact-integer?]{

Returns the width in characters of the given @tech{block}.}


@defstruct[collect-info ([ht any/c] [ext-ht any/c] [parts any/c] 
                         [tags any/c] [gen-prefix any/c] 
                         [relatives any/c] 
                         [parents (listof part?)])]{

Encapsulates information accumulated (or being accumulated) from the
@techlink{collect pass}. The fields are exposed, but not currently
intended for external use, except that @scheme[collect-info-parents]
is intended for external use.

}

@defstruct[resolve-info ([ci any/c] [delays any/c] [undef any/c])]{

Encapsulates information accumulated (or being accumulated) from the
@techlink{resolve pass}. The fields are exposed, but not currently
intended for external use.

}

@defproc[(info-key? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @scheme[#t] if @scheme[v] is an @deftech{info key}: a list of
at least two elements whose first element is a symbol. The result is
@scheme[#f] otherwise.

For a list that is an info tag, the interpretation of the second
element of the list is effectively determined by the leading symbol,
which classifies the key. However, a @scheme[#f] value as the second
element has an extra meaning: collected information mapped by such
info keys is not propagated out of the part where it is collected;
that is, the information is available within the part and its
sub-parts, but not in ancestor or sibling parts.

Note that every @techlink{tag} is an info key.

}

@defproc[(collect-put! [ci collect-info?] [key info-key?] [val any/c])
         void?]{

Registers information in @scheme[ci]. This procedure should be called
only during the @techlink{collect pass}.

}

@defproc[(resolve-get [p (or/c part? false/c)] [ri resolve-info?] [key info-key?])
         any/c]{

Extract information during the @techlink{resolve pass} or
@techlink{render pass} for @scheme[p] from @scheme[ri], where the
information was previously registered during the @techlink{collect
pass}. See also @secref["passes"].

The result is @scheme[#f] if the no value for the given key is found.
Furthermore, the search failure is recorded for potential consistency
reporting, such as when @exec{setup-plt} is used to build
documentation.

}


@defproc[(resolve-get/ext? [p (or/c part? false/c)] [ri resolve-info?] [key info-key?])
         (values any/c boolean?)]{

Like @scheme[render-get], but returns a second value to indicate
whether the resulting information originated from an external source
(i.e., a different document).}


@defproc[(resolve-search [dep-key any/c][p (or/c part? false/c)] [ri resolve-info?] [key info-key?])
         void?]{

Like @scheme[resolve-get], but a shared @scheme[dep-key] groups
multiple searches as a single request for the purposes of consistency
reporting and dependency tracking. That is, a single success for the
same @scheme[dep-key] means that all of the failed attempts for the
same @scheme[dep-key] have been satisfied. However, for dependency
checking, such as when using @exec{setup-plt} to re-build
documentation, all attempts are recorded (in case external changes
mean that an earlier attempt would succeed next time).

}

@defproc[(resolve-get/tentative [p (or/c part? false/c)] [ri resolve-info?] [key info-key?])
         any/c]{

Like @scheme[resolve-search], but without dependency tracking. For
multi-document settings where dependencies are normally tracked, such
as when using @exec{setup-plt} to build documentation, this function
is suitable for use only for information within a single document.

}

@defproc[(resolve-get-keys [p (or/c part? false/c)]
                           [ri resolve-info?] 
                           [pred (info-key? . -> . any/c)])
         list?]{

Applies @scheme[pred] to each key mapped for @scheme[p] in
@scheme[ri], returning a list of all keys for which @scheme[pred]
returns a true value.

}

@defproc[(part-collected-info [p part?]
                              [ri resolve-info?])
         collected-info?]{

Returns the information collected for @scheme[p] as recorded within
@scheme[ri].

}

@defproc[(tag-key [t tag?] [ri resolve-info?]) tag?]{

Converts a @scheme[generated-tag] value with @scheme[t] to a string.

}
