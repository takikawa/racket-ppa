@section[#:tag "scribble:manual:code"]{Typesetting Code}

@defform[(schemeblock datum ...)]{

Typesets the @scheme[datum] sequence as a table of Scheme code inset
by two spaces. The source locations of the @scheme[datum]s determine
the generated layout. For example,

@schemeblock[
(schemeblock
 (define (loop x)
   (loop (not x))))
]

produces the output

@schemeblock[
(define (loop x)
  (loop (not x)))
]

with the @scheme[(loop (not x))] indented under @scheme[define],
because that's the way it is idented the use of @scheme[schemeblock].

Furthermore, @scheme[define] is typeset as a keyword (bold and black)
and as a hyperlink to @scheme[define]'s definition in the reference
manual, because this document was built using a for-label binding of
@scheme[define] (in the source) that matches a definition in the
reference manual. Similarly, @scheme[not] is a hyperlink to the its
definition in the reference manual.

Use @scheme[unsyntax] to escape back to an expression that produces an
@scheme[element]. For example,

@let[([unsyntax #f])
(schemeblock
 (schemeblock
   (+ 1 (unsyntax (elem (scheme x) (subscript "2"))))))
]

produces

@schemeblock[
(+ 1 (unsyntax (elem (scheme x) (subscript "2"))))
]

The @scheme[unsyntax] form is regonized via
@scheme[free-identifier=?], so if you want to typeset code that
includes @scheme[unsyntax], you can simply hide the usual binding:

@SCHEMEBLOCK[
(schemeblock
  (let ([(UNSYNTAX (scheme unsyntax)) #f])
    (schemeblock
      (syntax (+ 1 (unsyntax x))))))
]

Or use @scheme[SCHEMEBLOCK], whose escape form is @scheme[UNSYNTAX]
instead of @scheme[unsyntax].

A few other escapes are recognized symbolically:

@itemize[

 @item{@scheme[(#,(scheme code:line) _datum ...)] typesets as the
       sequence of @scheme[_datum]s (i.e., without the
       @scheme[code:line] wrapper).}

 @item{@scheme[(#,(scheme code:comment) _datum)] typesets like
       @scheme[_datum], but colored as a comment and prefixed with a
       semi-colon. A typical @scheme[_datum] escapes from
       Scheme-typesetting mode using @scheme[unsyntax] and
       produces a paragraph using @scheme[t]: 

       @verbatim[#:indent 2]|{
         (code:comment #, @t{this is a comment})
       }|}

 @item{@schemeidfont{code:blank} typesets as a blank space.}

 @item{@schemeidfont{_}@scheme[_id] typesets as @scheme[id], but
       colored as a variable (like @scheme[schemevarfont]); this
       escape applies only if @schemeidfont{_}@scheme[_id] has no
       for-label binding and is not specifically colored as a subform
       non-terminal via @scheme[defform], a variable via
       @scheme[defproc], etc.}

@defform[(SCHEMEBLOCK datum ...)]{Like @scheme[schemeblock], but with
the expression escape @scheme[UNSYNTAX] instead of @scheme[unsyntax].}

@scheme[datum] are typeset after a prompt representing a REPL.}

@defform[(schememod lang datum ...)]{Like @scheme[schemeblock], but
the @scheme[datum] are typeset inside a @schememodfont{#lang}-form
module whose language is @scheme[lang]. The source location of
@scheme[lang] (relative to the body @scheme[datum]s) determines the
relative positioning of the @schememodfont{#lang} line in the typeset
output.}

@defform[(scheme datum ...)]{Like @scheme[schemeblock], but typeset on
a single line and wrapped with its enclosing paragraph, independent of
the formatting of @scheme[datum].}

@defform[(SCHEME datum ...)]{Like @scheme[scheme], but with the
@scheme[UNSYNTAX] escape like @scheme[schemeblock].}

@defform[(schemeresult datum ...)]{Like @scheme[scheme], but typeset
as a REPL value (i.e., a single color with no hyperlinks).}

@defform[(schemeid datum ...)]{Like @scheme[scheme], but typeset
as an unbound identifier (i.e., no coloring or hyperlinks).}

@defform*[((schememodname datum)
           (schememodname ((unsyntax (scheme unsyntax)) expr)))]{
Like @scheme[scheme], but typeset as a module path. If @scheme[datum]
is an identifier or @scheme[expr] produces a symbol, then it is
hyperlinked to the module path's definition as created by
@scheme[defmodule].}

@defproc[(litchar [str string?]) element?]{Typesets @scheme[str] as a
representation of literal text. Use this when you have to talk about
the individual characters in a stream of text, as as when documenting
a reader extension.}

@defproc[(verbatim [#:indent indent integer? 0] [str string?] ...)
         flow-element?]{Typesets @scheme[str]
as a table/paragraph in typewriter font with the linebreaks specified
by newline characters in @scheme[str]. ``Here strings'' are often
useful with @scheme[verbatim].}

@defproc[(schemefont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Typesets
@tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content] as uncolored, unhyperlinked
Scheme. This procedure is useful for typesetting things like
@schemefont{#lang}, which are not @scheme[read]able by themselves.}

@defproc[(schemevalfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as a value.}

@defproc[(schemeresultfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as a REPL result.}

@defproc[(schemeidfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as an identifier.}

@defproc[(schemevarfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as a variable (i.e., an argument or
sub-form in a procedure being documented).}

@defproc[(schemekeywordfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as a syntactic form name.}

@defproc[(schemeparenfont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored like parentheses.}

@defproc[(schememetafont [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as meta-syntax, such as backquote or
unquote.}

@defproc[(schemeerror [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Like
@scheme[schemefont], but colored as error-message text.}

@defproc[(procedure [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{Typesets
@tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content] as a procedure name in a REPL
result (e.g., in typewriter font with a @litchar{#<procedure:} prefix
and @litchar{>} suffix.).}

@defform[(var datum)]{Typesets @scheme[datum] as an identifier that is
an argument or sub-form in a procedure being documented. Normally, the
@scheme[defproc] and @scheme[defform] arrange for @scheme[scheme] to
format such identifiers automatically in the description of the
procedure, but use @scheme[var] if that cannot work for some reason.}

@defform[(svar datum)]{Like @scheme[var], but for subform non-terminals
in a form definition.}

@subsection{Typesetting Comments}

@defmodulereader[scribble/comment-reader]

As a reader module, @schememodname[scribble/comment-reader] reads a
single S-expression that contains @litchar{;}-based comment lines, and
it wraps the comments with @scheme[code:comment] for use with forms
like @scheme[schemeblock]. More precisely,
@schememodname[scribble/comment-reader] extends the current reader to
adjust the parsing of @litchar{;}.

For example, within a Scribble document that imports
@schememodname[scribble/manual],

@verbatim[#:indent 2]|{
  @#reader scribble/comment-reader
   (schemeblock
    ;; This is not a pipe
    (make-pipe)
   )
}|

generates

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
 (schemeblock
  ;; This is not a pipe
  (make-pipe)
 )

The initial @litchar["@"] is needed above to shift into S-expression
mode, so that @schememetafont{#reader} is recognized as a reader
declaration instead of literal text. Also, the example uses
@scheme[(schemeblock ....)]  instead of
@schememetafont["@"]@scheme[schemeblock]@schememetafont["["]@scheme[....]@schememetafont["]"]
because the @"@"-reader would drop comments within the
@scheme[schemeblock] before giving
@schememodname[scribble/comment-reader] a chance to convert them.

@; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
@section[#:tag "doc-modules"]{Documenting Modules}

@defform/subs[(defmodule maybe-req id maybe-sources pre-flow ...)

                              (code:line #:use-sources (mod-path ...))])]{

Produces a sequence of flow elements (encaptured in a @scheme[splice])
to start the documentation for a module that can be @scheme[require]d
using the path @scheme[id]. The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-flow]s
introduce the module, but need not include all of the module content.

Besides generating text, this form expands to a use of
@scheme[declare-exporting] with @scheme[id]; the
@scheme[#:use-sources] clause, if provided, is propagated to
@scheme[declare-exporting]. Consequently, @scheme[defmodule] should be
used at most once in a section, though it can be shadowed with
@scheme[defmodule]s in sub-sections.

If a @scheme[#:require-form] clause is provided, the given expression
produces an element to use instead of @scheme[(scheme require)] for
the declaration of the module. This is useful to suggest a different
way of accessing the module instead of through @scheme[require].

Hyperlinks created by @scheme[schememodname] are associated with the
enclosing section, rather than the local @scheme[id] text.}


@defform[(defmodulelang id maybe-sources pre-flow ...)]{

Like @scheme[defmodule], but documents @scheme[id] as a module path
suitable for use by either @scheme[require] or @schememodfont{#lang}.}

@defform[(defmodulelang*/no-declare (id ...) pre-flow ...)]

)]{

Like @scheme[defmodule*], etc., but without expanding to
@scheme[declare-exporting]. Use this form when you want to provide a
more specific list of modules (e.g., to name both a specific module
and one that combines several modules) via your own
@scheme[declare-exporting] declaration.}

@defform/subs[(declare-exporting mod-path ... maybe-sources)
              ([maybe-sources code:blank
                              (code:line #:use-sources (mod-path ...))])]{
                                 
Associates the @scheme[mod-path]s to all bindings defined within the
enclosing section, except as overridden by other
@scheme[declare-exporting] declarations in nested sub-sections.  The
list of @scheme[mod-path]s is shown, for example, when the user hovers
the mouse over one of the bindings defined within the section.

More significantly, the first @scheme[mod-path] plus the
@scheme[#:use-sources] @scheme[mod-path]s determine the binding that
is documented by each @scheme[defform], @scheme[defproc], or similar
form within the section that contains the @scheme[declare-exporting]
declaration:

@itemize[

 @item{If no @scheme[#:use-sources] clause is supplied, then the
       documentation applies to the given name as exported by the first
       @scheme[mod-path].}

 @item{If @scheme[#:use-sources] @scheme[mod-path]s are supplied, then
       they are tried in order. The first one to provide an export
       with the same symbolic name and
       @scheme[free-label-identifier=?] to the given name is used as
       the documented binding. This binding is assumed to be the same
       as the identifier as exported by the first @scheme[mod-path] in
       the @scheme[declare-exporting] declaration.}

]

The initial @scheme[mod-path]s sequence can be empty if
@scheme[mod-path]s are given with @scheme[#:use-sources]. In that
case, the rendered documentation never reports an exporting module for
identifiers that are documented within the section, but the
@scheme[mod-path]s in @scheme[#:use-sources] provide a binding context
for connecting (via hyperlinks) definitions and uses of identifiers.

The @scheme[declare-exporting] form should be used no more than once
per section, since the declaration applies to the entire section,
although overriding @scheme[declare-exporting] forms can appear in
sub-sections.}

               [ellipses+ #, @lit-ellipses+])]{

Produces a sequence of flow elements (encapsulated in a
@scheme[splice]) to document a procedure named @scheme[id]. Nesting
@scheme[prototype]s corresponds to a curried function, as in
@scheme[define]. The @scheme[id] is indexed, and it also registered so
that @scheme[scheme]-typeset uses of the identifier (with the same
for-label binding) are hyperlinked to this documentation.

A @scheme[defmodule] or @scheme[declare-exporting] form (or one of the
variants) in an enclosing section determines the @scheme[id] binding
that is being defined. The @scheme[id] should also have a for-label
binding (as introduced by @scheme[(require (for-label ....))]) that
matches the definition binding; otherwise, the defined @scheme[id]
will not typeset correctly within the definition.

Each @scheme[arg-spec] must have one of the following forms:

@specsubform[(arg-id contract-expr-datum)]{
       An argument whose contract is specified by
       @scheme[contract-expr-datum] which is typeset via
       @scheme[schemeblock0].}

@specsubform[(arg-id contract-expr-datum default-expr)]{
       Like the previous case, but with a default value. All arguments
       with a default value must be grouped together, but they can be
       in the middle of required arguments.}

@specsubform[(keyword arg-id contract-expr-datum)]{
       Like the first case, but for a keyword-based argument.}

@specsubform[(keyword arg-id contract-expr-datum default-expr)]{
       Like the previous case, but with a default
       value.}

@specsubform[#, @lit-ellipses]{Any number of the preceding argument.  This
       form is normally used at the end, but keyword-based arguments
       can sensibly appear afterward. See also the documentation for
       @scheme[append] for a use of @lit-ellipses before the last
       argument.}

@specsubform[#, @lit-ellipses+]{One or more of the preceding argument
       (normally at the end, like @lit-ellipses).}

The @scheme[result-contract-expr-datum] is typeset via
@scheme[schemeblock0], and it represents a contract on the procedure's
result.

The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-flow] documents the procedure. In this
description, references to @svar[arg-id]s using @scheme[scheme],
@scheme[schemeblock], @|etc| are typeset as procedure arguments.

The typesetting of all information before the @scheme[pre-flow]s
ignores the source layout, except that the local formatting is
preserved for contracts and default-values expressions.}


@defform[(defproc* ([prototype
                     result-contract-expr-datum] ...)
                   pre-flow ...)]{

Like @scheme[defproc], but for multiple cases with the same
@scheme[id]. 

When an @scheme[id] has multiple calling cases, they must be defined
with a single @scheme[defproc*], so that a single definition point
exists for the @scheme[id]. However, multiple distinct @scheme[id]s
can also be defined by a single @scheme[defproc*], for the case that
it's best to document a related group of procedures at once.}

Produces a sequence of flow elements (encapsulated in a
@scheme[splice]) to document a syntatic form named by @scheme[id]
whose syntax is described by @scheme[form-datum]. If no @scheme[#:id] is used
to specify @scheme[id], then @scheme[form-datum] must have the form
@scheme[(id . _datum)].

The @scheme[id] is indexed, and it is also registered so that
@scheme[scheme]-typeset uses of the identifier (with the same
for-label binding) are hyperlinked to this documentation.

The @scheme[defmodule] or @scheme[declare-exporting] requirements, as
well as the binding requirements for @scheme[id], are the same as for
@scheme[defproc].

The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-flow] documents the form. In this
description, a reference to any identifier in @scheme[form-datum] via
@scheme[scheme], @scheme[schemeblock], @|etc| is typeset as a sub-form
non-terminal. If @scheme[#:literals] clause is provided, however,
instances of the @scheme[literal-id]s are typeset normally (i.e., as
determined by the enclosing context).

If a @scheme[#:contracts] clause is provided, each
@scheme[subform-datum] (typically an identifier that serves as a
meta-variable in @scheme[form-datum]) is shown as producing a value
that must satisfy the contract described by @scheme[contract-expr-datum].

The typesetting of @scheme[form-datum], @scheme[subform-datum], and

Typesets @scheme[id] as a Scheme identifier, and also establishes the
identifier as the definition of a binding in the same way as
@scheme[defproc], @scheme[defform], etc. As always, the library that
provides the identifier must be declared via @scheme[defmodule] or
@scheme[declare-exporting] for an enclosing section.

If @scheme[form?] is a true value, then the identifier is documented
as a syntactic form, so that uses of the identifier (normally
including @scheme[id] itself) are typeset as a syntactic form.

If @scheme[index?] is a true value, then the identifier is registered
in the index.

If @scheme[show-libs?] is a true value, then the identifier's defining
module may be exposed in the typeset form (e.g., when viewing HTML and
the mouse hovers over the identifier).}

constructor and method specification are indented to visually group
them under the class definition.}

@defform[(defclass/title id super (intf-id ...) pre-flow ...)]{

The @scheme[maybe-mode] specifies whether the method overrides a
method from a superclass, and so on. (For these purposes, use
@scheme[#:mode override] when refining a method of an implemented

                 [#:underline? underline? any/c #t])
         element?]{

Inserts the hyperlinked title of the section tagged @scheme[tag], but
@schemeidfont{aux-element} items in the title content are omitted in the
hyperlink label.

If @scheme[#:doc module-path] is provided, the @scheme[tag] refers to
a tag with a prefix determined by @scheme[module-path]. When
@exec{setup-plt} renders documentation, it automatically adds a tag
prefix to the document based on the source module. Thus, for example,
to refer to a section of the PLT Scheme reference,
@scheme[module-path] would be @scheme['(lib
"scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")].

The @scheme[#:tag-prefixes prefixes] argument similarly supports
selecting a particular section as determined by a path of tag
prefixes. When a @scheme[#:doc] argument is provided, then
@scheme[prefixes] should trace a path of tag-prefixed subsections to
reach the @scheme[tag] section. When @scheme[#:doc] is not provided,
the @scheme[prefixes] path is relative to any enclosing section (i.e.,
the youngest ancestor that produces a match).

If @scheme[underline?] is @scheme[#f], then the hyperlink is rendered
in HTML without an underline.}

@defproc[(other-manual [module-path module-path?]
                       [#:underline? underline? any/c #t])

Like @scheme[secref] for the document's implicit @scheme["top"]
tag. Use this function to refer to a whole manual instead of
@scheme[secref], in case a special style in the future is used for
manual titles.}


@defproc[(schemelink [id symbol?] [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{

The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content] is hyperlinked to the definition
of @scheme[id].}

         element?]{

The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content] is hyperlinked to
@scheme[url].  If @scheme[style] is not supplied, then
@scheme[underline?] determines how the link is rendered.}


@defproc[(elemtag [t tag?] [pre-content any/c] ...) element?]{

The tag @scheme[t] refers to the content form of
@scheme[pre-content].}


@defproc[(elemref [t tag?] [pre-content any/c] ... 
                  [#:underline? underline? any/c #t]) element?]{

The @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content] is hyperlinked to @scheme[t],
which is normally defined using @scheme[elemtag].}


@defproc[(deftech [pre-content any/c] ...
                  [#:style? style? any/c #t]) element?]{

Produces an element for the @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content], and
also defines a term that can be referenced elsewhere using
@scheme[tech].

The @scheme[content->string] result of the @tech{decode}d
@scheme[pre-content] is used as a key for references, but normalized
as follows:

@itemize[

 @item{A trailing ``ies'' is replaced by ``y''.}

 @item{A trailing ``s'' is removed.}

 @item{Consecutive hyphens and whitespaces are all replaced by a
       single space.}

]

These normalization steps help support natural-language references
that differ slightly from a defined form. For example, a definition of
``bananas'' can be referenced with a use of ``banana''.

If @scheme[style?] is true, then @scheme[defterm] is used on
@scheme[pre-content].}

@defproc[(tech [pre-content any/c] ...

               [#:tag-prefixes prefixes (or/c (listof string?) false/c) #f])
         element?]{

Produces an element for the @tech{decode}d @scheme[pre-content], and
hyperlinks it to the definition of the content as established by
@scheme[deftech]. The content's string form is normalized in the same
way as for @scheme[deftech]. The @scheme[#:doc] and
@scheme[#:tag-prefixes] arguments support cross-document and
section-specific references, like in @scheme[secref].

With the default style files, the hyperlink created by @scheme[tech]
is somewhat quieter than most hyperlinks: the underline in HTML output
is gray, instead of blue, and the term and underline turn blue only
when the mouse is moved over the term.

In some cases, combining both natural-language uses of a term and
proper linking can require some creativity, even with the
normalization performed on the term. For example, if ``bind'' is
defined, but a sentence uses the term ``binding,'' the latter can be
linked to the former using @schemefont["@tech{bind}ing"].}

the link.}
