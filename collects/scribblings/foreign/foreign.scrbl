@title{@bold{FFI}: PLT Scheme Foreign Interface}

@author["Eli Barzilay"]

@defmodule[scheme/foreign]

The @schememodname[scheme/foreign] library enables the direct use of
C-based APIs within Scheme programs---without writing any new C
code. From the Scheme perspective, functions and data with a C-based
API are @idefterm{foreign}, hence the term @defterm{foreign
interface}. Furthermore, since most APIs consist mostly of functions,
the foreign interface is sometimes called a @defterm{foreign function
interface}, abbreviated @deftech{FFI}.

@bold{Important:} Many of the bindings documented here (the ones in
sections with titles starting ``Unsafe'') are available only after an
@scheme[(unsafe!)] declaration in the importing module.
