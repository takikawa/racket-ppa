@defclass/title[pen% object% ()]{

A pen is a drawing tool with a color, width, and style. A pen draws
 lines and outlines, such as the outline of a rectangle. In a
 monochrome destination, all non-white pens are drawn as black.

In addition to its color, width, and style, a pen can have a @deftech{pen stipple}
 bitmap. Drawing with a stipple pen is similar to
 calling @method[dc<%> draw-bitmap] with the stipple bitmap in region
 painted by the pen.

A @deftech{pen style} is one of the following:

@itemize[

 @item{@indexed-racket['transparent] --- Draws with no effect (on the
       outline of the drawn shape).}

 @item{@indexed-racket['solid] --- Draws using the pen's color. If a
        (monochrome) @tech{pen stipple} is installed into the pen, black pixels
        from the stipple are transferred to the destination using the
        brush's color, and white pixels from the stipple are not
        transferred.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['xor] --- The same as @racket['solid], accepted 
        only for partial backward compatibility.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['hilite] --- Draws with black and a @racket[0.3] alpha.}

 @item{The following special pen modes use the pen's color, and they only
       apply when a @tech{pen stipple} is not used:
    @itemize[
  @item{@indexed-racket['dot]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['long-dash]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['short-dash]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['dot-dash]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['xor-dot]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['xor-long-dash]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['xor-short-dash]}
  @item{@indexed-racket['xor-dot-dash]}
  ]}

]

To avoid creating multiple pens with the same characteristics, use the
 global @racket[pen-list%] object @indexed-racket[the-pen-list], or
 provide a color, width, and style to @xmethod[dc<%> set-pen].

When drawing in @racket['smoothed] or @racket['aligned] mode, a pen's
 size is truncated after scaling to an integral size. A pen of size
 @racket[0] (after truncation, if applicable) uses a non-zero,
 scale-insensitive line size for the destination drawing context:
 @racket[1/4] unit (after scaling) for @racket[post-script-dc%] or
 @racket[pdf-dc%] contexts in @racket['smoothed] mode, or @racket[1]
 unit (after scaling) for any other context.  For example, in unscaled 
 canvas and bitmap contexts, a zero-width pen behaves the same as a
 pen of size @racket[1].

See also @racket[make-pen].

Creates a pen with the given color, width, @tech{pen style}, @tech{cap style}, @tech{join style}, and
 @tech{pen stipple} bitmap.  For the case that the color is specified using a name, see
 @racket[color-database<%>] for information about color names; if the
 name is not known, the pen's color is black.

}

@defmethod[(get-cap) pen-cap-style/c]{

Returns the pen @deftech{cap style}, which determines the shape of a line at
each of its ending points when drawn by @method[dc<%> draw-line] or at the
non-connecting ends of lines when drawn by @method[dc<%> draw-lines] or
@method[dc<%> draw-path]. The default is @racket['round], which draws the
end of a line as a semi-circle. The @racket['projecting] style draws a
square in place of the semi-circle (i.e., past the point at which the
line stops). The @racket['butt] style ends the line with a straight
edge, instead of projecting past the ending point of the line.

This code draws three diagonal lines, one with each of the possible caps
(@racket['round], @racket['butt], and then @racket['projecting]) and puts
a little red dot on the end points of the line.

@defmethod[(get-join) pen-join-style/c]{

Returns the pen @deftech{join style} that is used between multiple lines
connected through @method[dc<%> draw-lines], @method[dc<%>
draw-rectangle], @method[dc<%> draw-polygon], or @method[dc<%>
draw-path].  The join style fills the space that would be left at the
outside corner of two lines if they were draw separately with
@racket['butt] line endings. The default join style is
@racket['round], which fills under an arc that lines up with the
outside of each of the two lines. The @racket['bevel] style fills in
the gap without adding extra pixels (i.e., it makes a blunt
corner). The @racket['miter] style fills the gap by adding pixels that
would be covered by both lines if they were extended past the corner
(i.e., it makes a sharp corner).

This code shows the three join styles
(@racket['round], @racket['bevel] and then @racket['miter])
by drawing a sequence
of lines, first with a sharp corner and then with a right-angle.
Each of the end points of the lines i with a red dot.
