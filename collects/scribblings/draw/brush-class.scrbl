@defclass/title[brush% object% ()]{

A brush is a drawing tool with a color and a style that is used for
 filling in areas, such as the interior of a rectangle or ellipse.  In
 a monochrome destination, all non-white brushes are drawn as black.

In addition to its color and style, a brush can have a @deftech{brush stipple} bitmap.
 Painting with a
 stipple brush is similar to calling @method[dc<%> draw-bitmap] with
 the stipple bitmap in the filled region.

As an alternative to a color, style, and stipple, a brush can have a
 @deftech{gradient} that is a @racket[linear-gradient%] or
 @racket[radial-gradient%]. When a brush has a gradient and the target
 for drawing is not monochrome, then other brush settings are
 ignored. With a gradient, for each point in a drawing destination,
 the gradient associates a color to the point based on starting and
 ending colors and starting and ending lines (for a linear gradient)
 or circles (for a radial gradient); a gradient-assigned color is
 applied for each point that is touched when drawing with the brush.
 By default, coordinates in the gradient are transformed by the
 drawing context's transformation when the brush is used, but a brush
 can have its own @deftech{gradient transformation} that is used, instead.
 A gradient transformation has the same representation and meaning as for
 @xmethod[dc<%> get-transformation].

A @deftech{brush style} is one of the following (but is ignored if the brush
 has a @tech{gradient} and the target is not monochrome):

@itemize[

 @item{@indexed-racket['transparent] --- Draws with no effect (on the
       interior of the drawn shape).}

 @item{@indexed-racket['solid] --- Draws using the brush's color. If a
        monochrome @tech{brush stipple} is installed into the brush, black pixels
        from the stipple are transferred to the destination using the
        brush's color, and white pixels from the stipple are not
        transferred.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['opaque] --- The same as @racket['solid] for a color
        @tech{brush stipple}. For a monochrome stipple, white pixels from 
        the stipple are
        transferred to the destination using the destination's
        background color.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['xor] --- The same as @racket['solid], accepted 
        only for partial backward compatibility.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['hilite] --- Draws with black and a @racket[0.3] alpha.}

 @item{@indexed-racket['panel] --- The same as @racket['solid], accepted 
        only for partial backward compatibility.}

 @item{The following modes correspond to built-in @tech{brush stipples} drawn in
       @racket['solid] mode:

  @itemize[
  @item{@indexed-racket['bdiagonal-hatch] --- diagonal lines, top-left to bottom-right}
  @item{@indexed-racket['crossdiag-hatch] --- crossed diagonal lines}
  @item{@indexed-racket['fdiagonal-hatch] --- diagonal lines, top-right to bottom-left}
  @item{@indexed-racket['cross-hatch] --- crossed horizontal and vertical lines}
  @item{@indexed-racket['horizontal-hatch] --- horizontal lines}
  @item{@indexed-racket['vertical-hatch] --- vertical lines}
  ]

        However, when a specific @tech{brush stipple} is installed into the brush,
        the above modes are ignored and @racket['solid] is
        used, instead.}

@index['("drawing" "outlines")]{To} draw outline shapes (such as
 unfilled boxes and ellipses), use the @racket['transparent] brush
 style.

To avoid creating multiple brushes with the same characteristics, use
 the global @racket[brush-list%] object
 @indexed-racket[the-brush-list], or provide a color and style to
 @xmethod[dc<%> set-brush].
