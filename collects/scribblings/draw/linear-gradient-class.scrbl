@defclass/title[linear-gradient% object% ()]{

A @deftech{linear gradient} is used with a @racket[brush%] to fill
 areas, such as the interior of a rectangle or ellipse, with smooth
 color transitions.

Colors transitions are based on a line, where colors are assigned to
 stop points along the line, and colors for in-between points are
 interpolated from the stop-point colors. The color of a point on the
 gradient's line is propagated to all points in the drawing context
 that are touched by a line through the point and perpendicular to the
 gradient's line.


@defconstructor[([x0 real?]
                 [y0 real?]
                 [x1 real?]
                 [y1 real?]
                 [stops (listof (list/c (real-in 0 1) (is-a?/c color%)))])]{

Creates a linear gradient with a line from (@racket[x0], @racket[y0])
to end point (@racket[x1], @racket[y1]). The @racket[stops] list
assigns colors to stop points along the line, where @racket[0.0]
corresponds to (@racket[x0], @racket[y0]), @racket[1.0] corresponds to
(@racket[x1], @racket[y2]), and numbers in between correspond to
points in between.
