@definterface[color:text<%> (text:basic<%>)]{
  This interface describes how coloring is stopped and started for text
  that knows how to color itself.  It also describes how to query the
  lexical and s-expression structure of the text.
  @defmethod*[(((start-colorer (token-sym-style (-> symbol? string?)) (get-token (-> input-port? (values any? symbol? (union false? symbol?) natural-number? natural-number?))) (pairs (listof (list/p symbol? symbol?)))) void))]{
    Starts tokenizing the buffer for coloring and parenthesis matching.


    token-sym-style will be passed the first return symbol from get-token
    and should return the style-name that the token should be colored.

    get-token takes an input port and returns the next token as 5 values:
    @itemize{
    @item{
    An unused value.  This value is intended to represent the textual
    component of the token and may be used as such in the future.}
    @item{
    A symbol describing the type of the token.  This symbol is transformed
    into a style-name via the token-sym->style argument.  The symbols
    'white-space and 'comment have special meaning and should always be
    returned for white space and comment tokens respectively.  The symbol
    @scheme['no-color] can be used to indicate that although the token is not white
    space, it should not be colored.  The symbol 'eof must be used to
    indicate when all the tokens have been consumed.}
    @item{
    A symbol indicating how the token should be treated by the paren
    matcher or @scheme[#f].  This symbol should be in the pairs argument.}
    @item{
    The starting position of the token.}
    @item{
    The ending position of the token.}}

    get-token will usually be implemented with a lexer using the 
    @scheme[parser-tools/lex] library.
    get-token must obey the following invariants:
    @itemize{
    @item{
    Every position in the buffer must be accounted for in exactly one
    token.}
    @item{
    The token returned by get-token must rely only on the contents of the
    input port argument.  This means that the tokenization of some part of
    the input cannot depend on earlier parts of the input.}
    @item{
    No edit to the buffer can change the tokenization of the buffer prior
    to the token immediately preceding the edit.  In the following
    example this invariant does not hold.  If the buffer contains:
    @verbatim{" 1 2 3}
    and the tokenizer treats the unmatched " as its own token (a string
    error token), and separately tokenizes the 1 2 and 3, an edit to make
    the buffer look like:
    @verbatim{" 1 2 3"}
    would result in a single string token modifying previous tokens.  To
    handle these situations, get-token must treat the first line as a
    single token.}}

    @scheme[pairs] is a list of different kinds of matching parens.  The second
    value returned by get-token is compared to this list to see how the
    paren matcher should treat the token.  An example: Suppose pairs is
    @scheme['((|(| |)|) (|[| |]|) (begin end))].  This means that there
    are three kinds of parens.  Any token which has 'begin as its second
    return value will act as an open for matching tokens with 'end.
    Similarly any token with @scheme['|]|] will act as a closing match for
    tokens with @scheme['|[|].  When trying to correct a mismatched
    closing parenthesis, each closing symbol in pairs will be converted to
    a string and tried as a closing parenthesis.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((stop-colorer (clear-colors boolean |#t|)) void))]{
    Stops coloring and paren matching the buffer.


    If clear-colors is true all the text in the buffer will have it's
    style set to Standard.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((force-stop-colorer (stop? boolean)) void))]{
    Causes the entire tokenizing/coloring system to become inactive.
    Intended for debugging purposes only.


    stop? determines whether the system is being forced to stop or allowed
    to wake back up.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((is-stopped?) boolean))]{
    Indicates if the colorer for this editor has been stopped, or not.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((is-frozen?) boolean))]{
    Indicates if this editor's colorer is frozen. See also
    @method[color:text<%> freeze-colorer]
    and
    @method[color:text<%> thaw-colorer].


  }
  @defmethod*[(((freeze-colorer) void))]{
    Keep the text tokenized and paren matched, but stop altering the colors.


    freeze-colorer will not return until the coloring/tokenization of the
    entire text is brought up-to-date.  It must not be called on a locked
    text.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((thaw-colorer (recolor boolean |#t|) (retokenize boolean |#f|)) void))]{
    Start coloring a frozen buffer again.


    If recolor? is @scheme[#t], the text is re-colored.  If it is
    @scheme[#f] the text is not recolored.  When recolor? is @scheme[#t],
    retokenize? controls how the text is recolored.  @scheme[#f] causes
    the text to be entirely re-colored before thaw-colorer returns using
    the existing tokenization.  @scheme[#t] causes the entire text to be
    retokenized and recolored from scratch.  This will happen in the
    background after the call to thaw-colorer returns.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((reset-region (start natural-number?) (end (union (quote end) natural-number?))) void))]{
    Set the region of the text that is tokenized.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((reset-regions (regions (listof (list number (union (quote end) number))))) void))]{

    Sets the currently active regions to be @scheme[regions].
  }
  @defmethod*[(((get-regions) (listof (list number (union (quote end) number)))))]{
    This returns the list of regions that are currently being colored in the editor.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((skip-whitespace (position natural-number?) (direction (symbols (quote forward) (quote backward))) (comments? boolean)) natural-number?))]{
    Returns the next non-whitespace character.


    Starts from position and skips whitespace in the direction indicated
    by direction.  If comments? is true, comments are skipped as well as
    whitespace.  skip-whitespace determines whitespaces and comments by
    comparing the token type to 'white-space and 'comment.

    Must only be called while the tokenizer is started.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((backward-match (position natural-number?) (cutoff natural-number?)) (union natural-number? false?)))]{



    Skip all consecutive whitespaces and comments (using skip-whitespace)
    immediately preceding the position.  If the token at this position is
    a close, return the position of the matching open, or @scheme[#f] if
    there is none.  If the token was an open, return @scheme[#f].  For any
    other token, return the start of that token.

    Must only be called while the tokenizer is started.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((backward-containing-sexp (position natural-number?) (cutoff natural-number?)) (union natural-number? false?)))]{

    Return the starting position of the interior of the (non-atomic)
    s-expression containing position, or @scheme[#f] is there is none.

    Must only be called while the tokenizer is started.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((forward-match (position natural-number?) (cutoff natural-number?)) (union natural-number? false?)))]{



    Skip all consecutive whitespaces and comments (using skip-whitespace)
    immediately following position.  If the token at this position is an
    open, return the position of the matching close, or @scheme[#f] if
    there is none.  For any other token, return the end of that token.

    Must only be called while the tokenizer is started.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((insert-close-paren (position natural-number?) (char char?) (flash? boolean) (fixup? boolean)) void))]{


    Position is the place to put the parenthesis and char is the
    parenthesis to be added.  If fixup? is true, the right kind of closing
    parenthesis will be chosen from the pairs list kept last passed to
    start-colorer, otherwise char will be inserted, even if it is not the
    right kind.  If flash? is true the matching open parenthesis will be
    flashed.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((classify-position (position natural-number?)) symbol?))]{


    Return a symbol for the lexer-determined token type for the token that
     contains the item after @scheme[position].

    Must only be called while the tokenizer is started.
  }
}
@defmixin[color:text-mixin (text:basic<%>) (color:text<%>)]{
  Adds the functionality needed for on-the-fly coloring and parenthesis
  matching based on incremental tokenization of the text.
