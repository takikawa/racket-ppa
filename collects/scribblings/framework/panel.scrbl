  See 
  @scheme[panel:single-mixin%].
  @defmethod*[(((active-child (child (is-a?/c area<%>))) void) ((active-child) (is-a?/c area<%>)))]{

    Sets the active child to be @scheme[child]


    Returns the current active child.
  }

@defmixin[panel:single-mixin (area-container<%>) (panel:single<%>)]{
  This mixin adds single panel functionality to an implementation of the 
  @scheme[area-container<%>] interface.

  Single panels place all of the children in the center of the panel,
  and allow make one child to be visible at a time. The 
  @method[panel:single<%> active-child]
  method controls which panel is currently active.

  The 
  @method[window<%> show]
  method is used to hide and show the children of a single panel.
  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((after-new-child (child subarea<%>)) void))]{

    Hides this child by calling @scheme[(send child show #f)], unless
    this is the first child in which case it does nothing.
  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((container-size) (values exact-integer exact-integer)))]{

    Returns the maximum width of all the children and the maximum height
    of all of the children.
  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((place-children) (listof (list exact-integer exact-integer exact-integer exact-integer))))]{

    Returns the positions for single panels and panes.
  }

  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((container-size (info (list-of (list exact-integer exact-integer boolean boolean)))) (values exact-integer exact-integer)))]{

    Factors the border width into the size calculation.

@definterface[panel:dragable<%> (window<%> area-container<%>)]{
  Classes matching this interface implement a panel where the
  user can adjust the percentage of the space that each takes
  up. The user adjusts the size by clicking and dragging the
  empty space between the children.
  @defmethod*[(((after-percentage-change) void))]{
    This method is called when the user changes the percentage
    by dragging the bar between the children, or when a new
    child is added to the frame, but not when
    @method[panel:dragable<%> set-percentages]
    is called.

    Use
    @method[panel:dragable<%> get-percentages]
    to find the current percentages.


  }
  @defmethod*[(((set-percentages (new-percentages (listof number))) void))]{
    Call this method to set the percentages that each window
    takes up of the panel.


    The argument, @scheme[new-percentages] must be a list of
    numbers that sums to 1. It's length must be equal to the
    number of children of the panel (see
    @method[area-container<%> get-children]) and each percentage must correspond to a number of pixels
    that is equal to or larger than the 
    minimum with of the child, as reported by
    @method[area<%> min-width].
  }
  @defmethod*[(((get-percentages) (listof numbers)))]{
    Return the current percentages of the children.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((get-vertical?) boolean))]{
    This method controls the behavior of the other overridden
    methods in mixins that implement this interface.

    If it returns @scheme[#t], the panel will be vertically
    aligned and if it returns @scheme[#f], they will be
    horizontally aligned.

  }

@definterface[panel:vertical-dragable<%> (panel:dragable<%>)]{
  A panel that implements
  @scheme[panel:vertical-dragable<%>]. It aligns its children vertically.

  A panel that implements
  @scheme[panel:horizontal-dragable<%>]. It aligns its children horizontally.

  This mixin adds the 
  @scheme[panel:dragable<%>]
  functionality to a
  @scheme[panel%].

  It is not useful unless the 
  @method[panel:dragable<%> get-vertical?]
  method is overridden.


  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((after-new-child (child (instance-of (is-a?/c area<%>)))) void))]{

    Updates the number of percentages to make sure that it
    matches the number of children and calls
    @method[panel:dragable<%> after-percentage-change].

  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((on-subwindow-event (receiver (instanceof window<%>)) (event (instanceof mouse-event%))) boolean))]{

    When the cursor is dragging the middle bar around, this
    method handles the resizing of the two panes.

    Places the children vertically in the panel, based on the percentages
    returned from
    @method[panel:dragable<%> get-percentages]. Also leaves a little gap between each pair of children.
