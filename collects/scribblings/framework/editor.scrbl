@definterface[editor:basic<%> (editor<%>)]{
  Classes matching this interface support the basic 
  @scheme[editor<%>]
  functionality required by the framework.
  @defmethod*[(((has-focus?) boolean))]{
    This function returns @scheme[#t] when the editor has the keyboard
    focus. It is implemented using:
    @method[editor<%> on-focus]

  }
  @defmethod*[(((local-edit-sequence?) boolean))]{
    Indicates if this editor is in an edit sequence. Enclosing buffer's
    edit-sequence status is not considered by this method.

    See
    @method[editor<%> begin-edit-sequence]
    and
    @method[editor<%> end-edit-sequence]
    for more info about edit sequences.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((run-after-edit-sequence (thunk (-> void)) (tag (union symbol? |#f|) |#f|)) void))]{
    This method is used to install callbacks that will be run after any
    edit-sequence completes.


    The procedure @scheme[thunk] will be called immediately if the edit is
    not in an edit-sequence. If the edit is in an edit-sequence, it will
    be called when the edit-sequence completes.

    If @scheme[tag] is a symbol, the @scheme[thunk] is keyed on that symbol, and
    only one thunk per symbol will be called after the
    edit-sequence. Specifically, the last call to 
    @method[editor:basic<%> run-after-edit-sequence]'s argument will be called.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((get-top-level-window) (union |#f| (is-a?/c top-level-window<%>))))]{
    Returns the 
    @scheme[top-level-window<%>]
    currently associated with this buffer.

    This does not work for embedded editors.


  }
  @defmethod*[(((save-file-out-of-date?) boolean))]{
    Returns @scheme[#t] if the file on disk has been modified, by some other program.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((save-file/gui-error (filename (union path |#f|) |#f|) (format (union (quote guess) (quote standard) (quote text) (quote text-force-cr) same copy) (quote same)) (show-errors? boolean |#t|)) boolean))]{
    This method is an alternative to 
    @method[editor<%> save-file]. Rather than showing errors via the original stdout, it
    opens a dialog with an error message showing the error.

    The result indicates if an error happened (the error has
    already been shown to the user). It returns @scheme[#t] if
    no error occurred and @scheme[#f] if an error occurred.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((load-file/gui-error (filename (union string |#f|) |#f|) (format (union (quote guess) (quote standard) (quote text) (quote text-force-cr) (quote same) (quote copy)) (quote guess)) (show-errors? boolean |#t|)) boolean))]{
    This method is an alternative to 
    @method[editor<%> load-file]. Rather than showing errors via the original stdout, it
    opens a dialog with an error message showing the error.

    The result indicates if an error happened (the error has
    already been shown to the user). It returns @scheme[#t] if
    no error occurred and @scheme[#f] if an error occurred.

  }
  @defmethod*[(((on-close) void))]{

    This method is called when an editor is closed.
    Typically, this method is called when the frame
    containing the editor is closed, but in some cases an
    editor is considered ``closed'' before the frame it is
    in is closed (eg, when a tab in DrScheme is closed), and
    thus @method[editor:basic<%> on-close] will be called at that point.
    

    See also
    @method[editor:basic<%> can-close?]
    and
    @method[editor:basic<%> close].


    Does nothing.
  }
  @defmethod*[(((can-close?) boolean))]{
    This method is called to query the editor if is okay to
    close the editor. Although there is no visible effect
    associated with closing an editor, there may be some cleanup
    actions that need to be run when the user is finished with
    the editor (asking if it should be saved, for example).

    See also
    @method[editor:basic<%> on-close] and
    @method[editor:basic<%> close].


    Returns @scheme[#t].
  }
  @defmethod*[(((close) boolean))]{
    This method is merely
    @schemeblock[
    (if (can-close?)
        (begin (on-close) #t)
        #f)]

    It is intended as a shorthand, helper method for closing
    an editor. See also
    @method[editor:basic<%> can-close?]
    and 
    @method[editor:basic<%> on-close].

  }
  @defmethod*[(((get-filename/untitled-name) string))]{
    Returns the printed version of the filename for this
    editor. If the editor doesn't yet have a filename, it
    returns a symbolic name (something like "Untitled").

  }

  @defmethod[(get-pos/text [event (is-a?/c mouse-event%)])
             (values (or/c false/c (is-a?/c editor<%>))
	             (or/c false/c number?))]{

   This method's first result is @scheme[#f] when the mouse
   event does not correspond to a location in the editor. 
   
   If the first result is an @scheme[text%] object, then the
   second result will be a position in the editor and
   otherwise the second result will be @scheme[#f]. 

   The @scheme[editor<%>] object will always be the nearest
   enclosing editor containing the mouse click.
  }
}
@defmixin[editor:basic-mixin (editor<%>) (editor:basic<%>)]{
  This provides the basic editor services required by the rest of the
  framework.

  The result of this mixin uses the same initialization arguments as the
  mixin's argument.

  Each instance of a class created with this mixin contains a private
  @scheme[keymap%] that is chained to the global keymap via:
  @scheme[(send keymap chain-to-keymap (keymap:get-global) #f)].

  This installs the global keymap @scheme[keymap:get-global] to
  handle keyboard and mouse mappings not handled by @scheme[keymap]. The
  global keymap is created when the framework is invoked.
  @defmethod*[#:mode augment (((can-save-file? (filename string) (format symbol?)) boolean))]{

    Checks to see if the file on the disk has been modified out
    side of this editor, using
    @method[editor:basic<%> save-file-out-of-date?]. 
    If it has, this method prompts the user to be sure they want to save.

  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode augment (((after-save-file (success? boolean)) void))]{

    If the current filename is not a temporary filename, this method calls
    @scheme[handler:add-to-recent]with the current filename.

    to add the new filename to the list of recently opened files.

    Additionally, updates a private instance variable with the
    modification time of the file, for using in implementing
    @method[editor:basic<%> save-file-out-of-date?].

  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode augment (((after-load-file (success? boolean)) void))]{

    Updates a private instance variable with the modification
    time of the file, for using in implementing
    @method[editor:basic<%> save-file-out-of-date?]

  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((on-focus (on? boolean)) void))]{
    Manages the state to implement
    @method[editor:basic<%> has-focus?]

  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode augment (((on-edit-sequence) boolean))]{

    Always returns @scheme[#t]. Updates a flag for
    @method[editor:basic<%> local-edit-sequence?]
  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode augment (((after-edit-sequence) void))]{

    Helps to implement
    @method[editor:basic<%> run-after-edit-sequence].
  }
  @defmethod*[#:mode override (((on-new-box (type (union (quote pasteboard) (quote text)))) (instance editor-snip%)))]{

    Creates instances of

  This interface is implemented by the results of
  @scheme[editor:standard-style-list-mixin].
}
@defmixin[editor:standard-style-list-mixin (editor<%>) (editor:standard-style-list<%>)]{
  The mixin adds code to the initialization
  of the class that sets the editor's style
  list (via
  @method[editor<%> set-style-list])
  to the result of
  @scheme[editor:get-standard-style-list].

  In addition, it calls
  @method[editor<%> set-load-overwrites-styles]
  with @scheme[#f].
  This ensures that saved files with different
  settings for the style list do not clobber
  the shared style list.
}
@definterface[editor:keymap<%> (editor:basic<%>)]{
  Classes matching this interface add support for mixing in multiple
  keymaps. They provides an extensible interface to chained keymaps,
  through the
  @method[editor:keymap<%> get-keymaps]
  method.

  This editor is initialized by calling
  @scheme[add-editor-keymap-functions],
  @scheme[add-text-keymap-functions], and
  @scheme[add-pasteboard-keymap-functions].
  @defmethod*[(((get-keymaps) (list-of (instance keymap%))))]{
    The keymaps returned from this method are chained to this
    @scheme[editor<%>]'s keymap.

  Classes implementing this interface keep the
  @method[editor<%> auto-wrap]
  state set based on the
  @scheme['framework:auto-set-wrap?] preference
  (see @scheme[preferences:get] for more information about preferences).

  They install a preferences callback with
  @scheme[preferences:add-callback]
  that sets the state when the preference changes and 
  initialize the value of
  @method[editor<%> auto-wrap]
  to the current value of @scheme['framework:auto-set-wrap?]

    about saving (and saves if they ask).

    If the 
    @method[editor:file<%> allow-close-with-no-filename?]
