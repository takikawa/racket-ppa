@title[#:tag "modprotect"]{Code Inspectors}

In the same way that inspectors control access to structure fields
(see @secref["inspectors"]), inspectors also control access to
@tech{module bindings}. The default inspector for @tech{module
bindings} is determined by the @scheme[current-code-inspector]
parameter, instead of the @scheme[current-inspector] parameter.

When a @scheme[module] declaration is evaluated, the value of the
@scheme[current-code-inspector] parameter is associated with the
module declaration. When the module is invoked via @scheme[require] or
@scheme[dynamic-require], a sub-inspector of the module's
declaration-time inspector is created, and this sub-inspector is
associated with the module invocation. Any inspector that controls the
sub-inspector (i.e., the declaration-time inspector and its superior)
controls the module invocation.

Control over a module invocation enables

@itemize{

 @item{the use of @scheme[module->namespace] on the module;}

 @item{access to the module's protected identifiers, i.e. those
 identifiers exported from the module with @scheme[protect]; and}

 @item{access to the module's protected and unexported variables
 within compiled code from @scheme[read] (see @scheme[current-compile]).}

}

If the value of @scheme[current-code-inspector] never changes, then no
control is lost for any module invocation, since the module's
invocation is associated with a sub-inspector of
@scheme[current-code-inspector].

The inspector for a module invocation is specific to a particular
module registry, in case a module is attached to a new registry via
@scheme[namespace-attach-module]. The invocation inspector in a
particular registry can be changed via
@scheme[namespace-unprotect-module] (but changing the inspector
requires control over the old one).

Control over a module declaration (as opposed to a mere invocation)
enables the reconstruction of syntax objects that contain references
to the module's unexported identifiers. Otherwise, the compiler and
macro expander prevent any reference to an unexported identifier,
unless the reference appears within an expression that was generated
by the module's macros (or, more precisely, a macro from a module
whose declaration inspector controls the invocation of the
identifier's module). See @secref["stxcerts"] for further
information.

@defparam[current-code-inspector insp inspector?]{

A parameter that determines an inspector to control access to module
bindings and redefinitions.}
