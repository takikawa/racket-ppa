@defproc[(read-char [in input-port? (current-input-port)]) 
         (or/c character? eof-object?)]{

Reads a single character from @scheme[in]---which may involve reading
several bytes to UTF-8-decode them into a character (see
@secref["ports"]); a minimal number of bytes are read/peeked to
perform the decoding. If no bytes are available before an end-of-file,
then @scheme[eof] is returned.}


@defproc[(read-byte [in input-port? (current-input-port)]) 
         (or/c byte? eof-object?)]{

Reads a single byte from @scheme[in]. If no bytes are available before
an end-of-file, then @scheme[eof] is returned.}


@defproc[(read-line [in input-port? (current-input-port)]
                    [mode (one-of 'linefeed 'return 'return-linefeed 'any 'any-one) 'linefeed])
         (or/c string? eof-object?)]{

Returns a string containing the next line of bytes from @scheme[in].

Characters are read from @scheme[in] until a line separator or an
end-of-file is read. The line separator is not included in the result
string (but it is removed from the port's stream). If no characters
are read before an end-of-file is encountered, @scheme[eof] is
returned.

The @scheme[mode] argument determines the line separator(s). It
must be one of the following symbols:

 @itemize{

  @item{@indexed-scheme['linefeed] breaks lines on linefeed characters.}

  @item{@indexed-scheme['return] breaks lines on return characters.}

  @item{@indexed-scheme['return-linefeed] breaks lines on
  return-linefeed combinations. If a return character is not followed
  by a linefeed character, it is included in the result string;
  similarly, a linefeed that is not preceded by a return is included
  in the result string.}

  @item{@indexed-scheme['any] breaks lines on any of a return
  character, linefeed character, or return-linefeed combination. If a
  return character is followed by a linefeed character, the two are
  treated as a combination.}

  @item{@indexed-scheme['any-one] breaks lines on either a return or
  linefeed character, without recognizing return-linefeed
  combinations.}

}

Return and linefeed characters are detected after the conversions that
are automatically performed when reading a file in text mode. For
example, reading a file in text mode under Windows automatically
changes return-linefeed combinations to a linefeed. Thus, when a file
is opened in text mode, @scheme['linefeed] is usually the appropriate
@scheme[read-line] mode.}

@defproc[(read-bytes-line [in input-port? (current-input-port)] 
                    [mode (one-of 'linefeed 'return 'return-linefeed 'any 'any-one) 'linefeed])

                      [in input-port? (current-input-port)])
         (or/c string? eof-object)]{

Returns a string containing the next @scheme[amt] characters from
@scheme[in].

If @scheme[amt] is @scheme[0], then the empty string is
returned. Otherwise, if fewer than @scheme[amt] characters are
available before an end-of-file is encountered, then the returned
string will contain only those characters before the end-of-file; that
is, the returned string's length will be less than @scheme[amt]. (A
temporary string of size @scheme[amt] is allocated while reading the
input, even if the size of the result is less than @scheme[amt]
characters.) If no characters are available before an end-of-file,
then @scheme[eof] is returned.

If an error occurs during reading, some characters may be lost; that
is, if @scheme[read-string] successfully reads some characters before
encountering an error, the characters are dropped.}

@defproc[(read-bytes [amt nonnegative-exact-integer?]
                     [in input-port? (current-input-port)])
         (or/c bytes? eof-object)]{
Like @scheme[read-string], but reads bytes and produces a byte string.}

@defproc[(read-string! [str (and/c string? (not/c immutable?))]
                       [in input-port? (current-input-port)]
                       [start-pos nonnegative-exact-integer? 0]
                       [end-pos nonnegative-exact-integer? (string-length str)])
         (or/c positive-exact-integer? eof-object?)]{

Reads characters from @scheme[in] like @scheme[read-string], but puts
them into @scheme[str] starting from index @scheme[start-pos]
(inclusive) up to @scheme[end-pos] (exclusive). Like
@scheme[substring], the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract] if
@scheme[start-pos] or @scheme[end-pos] is out-of-range for
@scheme[str].

If the difference between @scheme[start-pos] and @scheme[end-pos] is
@scheme[0], then @scheme[0] is returned and @scheme[str] is not
modified. If no bytes are available before an end-of-file, then
@scheme[eof] is returned. Otherwise, the return value is the number of
characters read. If @math{m} characters are read and
@math{m<@scheme[end-pos]-@scheme[start-pos]}, then @scheme[str] is
not modified at indices @math{@scheme[start-pos]+m} though
@scheme[end-pos].}

Like @scheme[read-string!], but reads bytes, puts them into a byte
string, and returns the number of bytes read.}

@defproc[(read-bytes-avail! [bstr bytes?]

         (or/c positive-exact-integer? eof-object? procedure?)]{

Like @scheme[read-bytes!], but it returns without blocking after
reading immediately-available bytes, and it may return a procedure for
a ``special'' result. The @scheme[read-bytes-avail!] procedure blocks
only if no bytes (or specials) are yet available. Also unlike
@scheme[read-bytes!], @scheme[read-bytes-avail!] never drops bytes; if
@scheme[read-bytes-avail!] successfully reads some bytes and then
encounters an error, it suppresses the error (treating it roughly like
an end-of-file) and returns the read bytes.  (The error will be
triggered by future reads.) If an error is encountered before any
bytes have been read, an exception is raised.

When @scheme[in] produces a special value, as described in
@secref["customport"], the result is a procedure of four
arguments. The four arguments correspond to the location of the
special value within the port, as described in
@secref["customport"]. If the procedure is called more than once
with valid arguments, the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract]. If
@scheme[read-bytes-avail] returns a special-producing procedure, then
it does not place characters in @scheme[bstr]. Similarly,
@scheme[read-bytes-avail] places only as many bytes into @scheme[bstr]
as are available before a special value in the port's stream.}

@defproc[(read-bytes-avail!* [bstr bytes?]

         (or/c nonnegative-exact-integer? eof-object? procedure?)]{

Like @scheme[read-bytes-avail!], but returns @scheme[0] immediately if
no bytes (or specials) are available for reading and the end-of-file
is not reached.}

@defproc[(read-bytes-avail!/enable-break [bstr bytes?]

         (or/c positive-exact-integer? eof-object? procedure?)]{

Like @scheme[read-bytes-avail!], but breaks are enabled during the
read (see also @secref["breakhandler"]). If breaking is disabled
when @scheme[read-bytes-avail!/enable-break] is called, and if the
@scheme[exn:break] exception is raised as a result of the call, then
no bytes will have been read from @scheme[in].}


@defproc[(peek-string [amt nonnegative-exact-integer?]
                      [skip-bytes-amt nonnegative-exact-integer?]
                      [in input-port? (current-input-port)])
         (or/c string? eof-object)]{

Similar to @scheme[read-string], except that the returned characters
are preserved in the port for future reads. (More precisely, undecoded
bytes are left for future reads.) The @scheme[skip-bytes-amt] argument
indicates a number of bytes (@italic{not} characters) in the input
stream to skip before collecting characters to return; thus, in total,
the next @scheme[skip-bytes-amt] bytes plus @scheme[amt] characters
are inspected.

For most kinds of ports, inspecting @scheme[skip-bytes-amt] bytes and
@scheme[amt] characters requires at least
@math{@scheme[skip-bytes-amt]+@scheme[amt]} bytes of memory overhead
associated with the port, at least until the bytes/characters are
read. No such overhead is required when peeking into a string port
(see @secref["stringport"]), a pipe port (see
@secref["pipeports"]), or a custom port with a specific peek
procedure (depending on how the peek procedure is implemented; see
@secref["customport"]).

If a port produces @scheme[eof] mid-stream, peek skips beyond the
@scheme[eof] always produce @scheme[eof] until the @scheme[eof] is
read.}

Like @scheme[read-bytes-avail!], but for peeking, and with two extra
arguments. The @scheme[skip-bytes-amt] argument is as in
@scheme[peek-bytes].  The @scheme[progress] argument must be either
@scheme[#f] or an event produced by
@scheme[port-progress-evt] for @scheme[in].

To peek, @scheme[peek-bytes-avail!] blocks until finding an
end-of-file, at least one byte (or special) past the skipped bytes, or
until a non-@scheme[#f] @scheme[progress] becomes ready. Furthermore,
if @scheme[progress] is ready before bytes are peeked, no bytes are
peeked or skipped, and @scheme[progress] may cut short the skipping
process if it becomes available during the peek attempt.

The result of @scheme[peek-bytes-avail!] is @scheme[0] only in the
case that @scheme[progress] becomes ready before bytes are peeked.}
