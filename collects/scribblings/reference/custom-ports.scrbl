@title[#:tag "mz:customport"]{Custom Ports}

The @scheme[make-input-port] and @scheme[make-output-port] procedures
create custom ports with arbitrary control procedures (much like
implementing a device driver). Custom ports are mainly useful to
obtain fine control over the action of committing bytes as read or
written.

         input-port?]{

Creates an input port, which is immediately open for reading. If
@scheme[close] procedure has no side effects, then the port need not
be explicitly closed.

The arguments implement the port as follows:

@itemize{

  @item{@scheme[name] --- the name for the input port.}

  @item{@scheme[read-in] --- a procedure that takes a single argument:
    a mutable byte string to receive read bytes. The procedure's
    result is one of the following:
%
    @itemize{

      @item{the number of bytes read, as an exact, non-negative integer;}

      @item{@scheme[eof];}

      @item{a procedure of arity four (representing a ``special''
      result, as discussed further below) and optionally of arity zero,
      but a procedure result is allowed only when
      @scheme[peek] is not @scheme[#f]; or}

      @item{a @tech{synchronizable event} (see @secref["mz:sync"])
      that becomes ready when the read is complete (roughly): the
      event's value can one of the above three results or another
      event like itself; in the last case, a reading process loops
      with @scheme[sync] until it gets a non-event result.}

    }

    The @scheme[read-in] procedure must not block indefinitely. If no
    bytes are immediately available for reading, the @scheme[read-in]
    must return @scheme[0] or an event, and preferably an event (to
    avoid busy waits). The @scheme[read-in] should not return
    @scheme[0] (or an event whose value is @scheme[0]) when data is
    available in the port, otherwise polling the port will behave
    incorrectly. An event result from an event can also break polling.

    If the result of a @scheme[read-in] call is not one of the above
    values, the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract]. If a returned integer is
    larger than the supplied byte string's length, the
    @exnraise[exn:fail:contract]. If @scheme[peek] is
    @scheme[#f] and a procedure for a special result is returned, the
    @exnraise[exn:fail:contract].

    The @scheme[read-in] procedure can report an error by raising an
    exception, but only if no bytes are read. Similarly, no bytes
    should be read if @scheme[eof], an event, or a procedure is
    returned. In other words, no bytes should be lost due to spurious
    exceptions or non-byte data.

    A port's reading procedure may be called in multiple threads
    simultaneously (if the port is accessible in multiple threads),
    and the port is responsible for its own internal
    synchronization. Note that improper implementation of such
    synchronization mechanisms might cause a non-blocking read
    procedure to block indefinitely.

    If @scheme[peek], @scheme[get-progress-evt], and
    @scheme[commit] are all provided and
    non-@scheme[#f], then the following is an acceptable implementation
    of @scheme[read-in]:

@schemeblock[
(code:line
   (lambda (bstr)
     (let* ([progress-evt (get-progress-evt)]
            [v (peek bstr 0 progress-evt)])
       (cond
        [(sync/timeout 0 progress-evt) 0] (code:comment #,(t "try again"))
        [(evt? v) (wrap-evt v (lambda (x) 0))] (code:comment #,(t "sync, try again"))
        [(and (number? v) (zero? v)) 0] (code:comment #,(t "try again"))
        [else
         (if (commit (if (number? v) v 1)
                         progress-evt
                         always-evt)
             v      (code:comment #,(t "got a result"))
             0)]))) (code:comment #,(t "try again"))
)]

    An implementor may choose not to implement the @scheme[peek],
    @scheme[get-progress-evt], and @scheme[commit]
    procedures, however, and even an implementor who does supply
    them may provide a different @scheme[read-in]
    that uses a fast path for non-blocking reads.}


  @item{@scheme[peek] --- either @scheme[#f] or a procedure
   that takes three arguments:

     @itemize{

     @item{a mutable byte string to receive peeked bytes;}

     @item{a non-negative number of bytes (or specials) to skip before
     peeking; and}

     @item{either @scheme[#f] or a progress event produced by
     @scheme[get-progress-evt].}

     }

    The results and conventions for @scheme[peek] are
    mostly the same as for @scheme[read-in]. The main difference is in
    the handling of the progress event, if it is not @scheme[#f].  If
    the given progress event becomes ready, the
    @scheme[peek] must abort any skip attempts and not peek
    any values. In particular, @scheme[peek] must not peek
    any values if the progress event is initially ready.
    
    Unlike @scheme[read-proc], @scheme[peek] should produce
    @scheme[#f] (or an event whose value is @scheme[#f]) if no bytes
    were peeked because the progress event became ready. Like
    @scheme[read-in], a @scheme[0] result indicates that another
    attempt is likely to succeed, so @scheme[0] is inappropriate when
    the progress event is ready. Also like @scheme[read-in],
    @scheme[peek] must not block indefinitely.

    The skip count provided to @scheme[peek] is a number of
    bytes (or specials) that must remain present in the port---in
    addition to the peek results---when the peek results are
    reported. If a progress event is supplied, then the peek is
    effectively canceled when another process reads data before the
    given number can be skipped. If a progress event is not supplied
    and data is read, then the peek must effectively restart with the
    original skip count.

    The system does not check that multiple peeks return consistent
    results, or that peeking and reading produce consistent results.

    If @scheme[peek] is @scheme[#f], then peeking for the
    port is implemented automatically in terms of reads, but with
    several limitations. First, the automatic implementation is not
    thread-safe. Second, the automatic implementation cannot handle
    special results (non-byte and non-eof), so @scheme[read-in] cannot
    return a procedure for a special when @scheme[peek] is
    @scheme[#f]. Finally, the automatic peek implementation is
    incompatible with progress events, so if @scheme[peek]
    is @scheme[#f], then @scheme[progress-evt] and
    @scheme[commit] must be @scheme[#f]. See also
    @scheme[make-input-port/peek-to-read].}

  @item{@scheme[close] --- a procedure of zero arguments that is
    called to close the port. The port is not considered closed until
    the closing procedure returns. The port's procedures will never be
    used again via the port after it is closed. However, the closing
    procedure can be called simultaneously in multiple threads (if the
    port is accessible in multiple threads), and it may be called
    during a call to the other procedures in another thread; in the
    latter case, any outstanding reads and peeks should be terminated
    with an error.}

  @item{@scheme[get-progress-evt] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default), or a procedure that takes no arguments and returns an
    event. The event must become ready only after data is next read
    from the port or the port is closed. After the event becomes
    ready, it must remain so. (See also @scheme[semaphore-peek-evt].)

    If @scheme[get-progress-evt] is @scheme[#f], then
    @scheme[port-provides-progress-evts?] applied to the port will
    produce @scheme[#f], and the port will not be a valid argument to
    @scheme[port-progress-evt].}

  @item{@scheme[commit] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default), or a procedure that takes three arguments: 

     @itemize{

     @item{an exact, positive integer @math{k_r};}

     @item{a progress event produced by @scheme[get-progress-evt];}

     @item{an event, @scheme[done], that is either a channel-put
           event, channel, semaphore, semaphore-peek event, always
           event, or never event.}

     }

     A @defterm{commit} corresponds to removing data from the stream
     that was previously peeked, but only if no other process removed
     data first. (The removed data does not need to be reported,
     because it has been peeked already.) More precisely, assuming
     that @math{k_p} bytes, specials, and mid-stream @scheme[eof]s have
     been previously peeked or skipped at the start of the port's
     stream, @scheme[commit] must satisfy the following
     constraints:

     @itemize{

     @item{It must return only when the commit is complete or when the
     given progress event becomes ready.}

     @item{It must commit only if @math{k_p} is positive.}

     @item{If it commits, then it must do so with either @math{k_r} items
     or @math{k_p} items, whichever is smaller, and only if @math{k_p} is
     positive.}

     @item{It must never choose @scheme[done] in a synchronization
     after the given progress event is ready, or after @scheme[done]
     has been synchronized once.}

     @item{It must not treat any data as read from the port unless
     @scheme[done] is chosen in a synchronization.}

     @item{It must not block indefinitely if @scheme[done] is ready;
     it must return soon after the read completes or soon after the
     given progress event is ready, whichever is first.}

     @item{It can report an error by raising an exception, but only if
      no data is committed. In other words, no data should be lost due to
      an exception, including a break exception.}

     @item{It must return a true value if data is committed,
     @scheme[#f] otherwise. When it returns a value, the given
     progress event must be ready (perhaps because data was just
     committed).}

     @item{It must raise an exception if no data (including
     @scheme[eof]) has been peeked from the beginning of the port's
     stream, or if it would have to block indefinitely to wait for the
     given progress event to become ready.}

     }

    A call to @scheme[commit] is @scheme[parameterize-break]ed to
    disable breaks.}

  @item{@scheme[get-location] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default), or a procedure that takes no arguments and returns three
    values: the line number for the next item in the port's stream (a
    positive number or @scheme[#f]), the column number for the next
    item in the port's stream (a non-negative number or @scheme[#f]),
    and the position for the next item in the port's stream (a
    positive number or @scheme[#f]). See also @secref["mz:linecol"].  

    This procedure is only called if line counting is enabled for the
    port via @scheme[port-count-lines!] (in which case
    @scheme[count-lines!] is called). The @scheme[read],
    @scheme[read-syntax], @scheme[read-honu], and
    @scheme[read-honu-syntax] procedures assume that reading a
    non-whitespace character increments the column and position by
    one.}

  @item{@scheme[count-lines!] --- a procedure of no arguments
    that is called if and when line counting is enabled for the port.
    The default procedure is @scheme[void].}

  @item{@scheme[init-position] --- an exact, positive integer that
    determines the position of the port's first item, used when line
    counting is @italic{not} enabled for the port. The default is
    @scheme[1].}

  @item{@scheme[buffer-mode] --- either @scheme[#f] (the default) or a
    procedure that accepts zero or one arguments. If
    @scheme[buffer-mode] is @scheme[#f], then the resulting port does
    not support a buffer-mode setting. Otherwise, the procedure is
    called with one symbol argument (@scheme['block] or
    @scheme['none]) to set the buffer mode, and it is called with zero
    arguments to get the current buffer mode. In the latter case, the
    result must be @scheme['block], @scheme['none], or @scheme[#f]
    (unknown). See @secref["mz:port-buffers"] for more information on
    buffer modes.}

 }

 When @scheme[read-in] or @scheme[peek] (or an event produced by one
 of these) returns a procedure, and the procedure is used to obtain a
 non-byte result. (This non-byte result is @italic{not} intended to
 return a character or @scheme[eof]; in particular, @scheme[read-char]
 raises an exception if it encounters a special-result procedure, even
 if the procedure produces a byte.) A special-result procedure must
 accept four arguments, and it can optionally accept zero arguments:

 @itemize{

  @item{When the special read is triggered by @scheme[read-syntax],
  @scheme[read-honu-syntax], or @scheme[read-syntax/recursive], the
  procedure is passed four arguments that represent a source
  location.}

  @item{When the special read is triggered by @scheme[read],
  @scheme[read-honu], @scheme[read-byte-or-special],
  @scheme[read-char-or-special], @scheme[peek-byte-or-special], or
  @scheme[peek-char-or-special], the procedure is passed no arguments
  if it accepts zero arguments, otherwise it is passed four arguments
  that are all @scheme[#f].}

 }

 The special-value procedure can return an arbitrary value, and it
 will be called zero or one times (not necessarily before further
 reads or peeks from the port). See @secref["mz:reader-procs"] for
 more details on the procedure's result.

 If @scheme[read-in] or @scheme[peek] returns a special
 procedure when called by any reading procedure other than
 @scheme[read], @scheme[read-syntax], @scheme[read-honu],
 @scheme[read-honu-syntax], @scheme[read-char-or-special],
 @scheme[peek-char-or-special], @scheme[read-byte-or-special], or
 @scheme[peek-byte-or-special], then the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract].}

          output-port?]{

Creates an output port, which is immediately open for
writing. If @scheme[close] procedure has no side effects, then
the port need not be explicitly closed. The port can buffer data
within its @scheme[write-out] and @scheme[write-out-special]
procedures.

 @itemize{

   @item{@scheme[name] --- the name for the output port.}

   @item{@scheme[evt] --- a synchronization event (see @secref["mz:sync"];
    e.g., a semaphore or another port). The event is used in place of
    the output port when the port is supplied to synchronization
    procedures like @scheme[sync].  Thus, the event should be
    unblocked when the port is ready for writing at least one byte
    without blocking, or ready to make progress in flushing an
    internal buffer without blocking. The event must not unblock
    unless the port is ready for writing; otherwise, the guarantees of
    @scheme[sync] will be broken for the output port. Use
    @scheme[always-evt] if writes to the port always succeed without
    blocking.}

   @item{@scheme[write-out] --- a procedure of five arguments:

     @itemize{

     @item{an immutable byte string containing bytes to write;}

     @item{a non-negative exact integer for a starting offset
     (inclusive) into the byte string;}

     @item{a non-negative exact integer for an ending offset
     (exclusive) into the byte string;}

     @item{a boolean; @scheme[#f] indicates that the port is allowed
     to keep the written bytes in a buffer, and that it is
     allowed to block indefinitely; @scheme[#t] indicates that the
     write should not block, and that the port should attempt to flush
     its buffer and completely write new bytes instead of
     buffering them;}

     @item{a boolean; @scheme[#t] indicates that if the port blocks
     for a write, then it should enable breaks while blocking (e.g.,
     using @scheme[sync/enable-break]; this argument is always
     @scheme[#f] if the fourth argument is @scheme[#t].}

     }

    The procedure returns one of the following:

     @itemize{

     @item{a non-negative exact integer representing the number of
     bytes written or buffered;}

     @item{@scheme[#f] if no bytes could be written, perhaps because
     the internal buffer could not be completely flushed;}

     @item{a synchronizable event (see @secref["mz:sync"]) that acts like
     the result of @scheme[write-bytes-avail-evt] to complete the
     write.}

     }

    Since @scheme[write-out] can produce an event, an acceptable
    implementation of @scheme[write-out] is to pass its first three
    arguments to the port's @scheme[get-write-evt]. Some port
    implementors, however, may choose not to provide
    @scheme[get-write-evt] (perhaps because writes cannot be
    made atomic), or may implement @scheme[write-proc] to
    enable a fast path for non-blocking writes or to
    enable buffering.

    From a user's perspective, the difference between buffered and
    completely written data is (1) buffered data can be lost in the
    future due to a failed write, and (2) @scheme[flush-output] forces
    all buffered data to be completely written. Under no circumstances
    is buffering required.
    
    If the start and end indices are the same, then the fourth
    argument to @scheme[write-out] will be @scheme[#f], and the write
    request is actually a flush request for the port's buffer (if
    any), and the result should be @scheme[0] for a successful flush
    (or if there is no buffer).

    The result should never be @scheme[0] if the start and end indices
    are different, otherwise the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract].
    If a returned integer is larger than the supplied byte-string
    range, the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract].

    The @scheme[#f] result should be avoided, unless the next write
    attempt is likely to work. Otherwise, if data cannot be written,
    return an event instead.

    An event returned by @scheme[write-out] can return @scheme[#f] or
    another event like itself, in contrast to events produced by
    @scheme[write-bytes-avail-evt] or @scheme[get-write-evt].
    A writing process loops with @scheme[sync] until it obtains a
    non-event result.

    The @scheme[write-out] procedure is always called with breaks
    disabled, independent of whether breaks were enabled when the write
    was requested by a client of the port. If breaks were enabled for
    a blocking operation, then the fifth argument to @scheme[write-out]
    will be @scheme[#t], which indicates that @scheme[write-out] should
    re-enable breaks while blocking.

    If the writing procedure raises an exception, due either to write
    or commit operations, it must not have committed any bytes
    (though it may have committed previously buffered bytes).

    A port's writing procedure may be called in multiple threads
    simultaneously (if the port is accessible in multiple
    threads). The port is responsible for its own internal
    synchronization. Note that improper implementation of such
    synchronization mechanisms might cause a non-blocking write
    procedure to block.}

  @item{@scheme[close] --- a procedure of zero arguments that is
    called to close the port. The port is not considered closed until
    the closing procedure returns. The port's procedures will never be
    used again via the port after it is closed. However, the closing
    procedure can be called simultaneously in multiple threads (if the
    port is accessible in multiple threads), and it may be called
    during a call to the other procedures in another thread; in the
    latter case, any outstanding writes or flushes should be
    terminated immediately with an error.}

  @item{@scheme[write-out-special] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default), or a procedure to handle @scheme[write-special] calls
    for the port. If @scheme[#f], then the port does not support
    special output, and @scheme[port-writes-special?] will return
    @scheme[#f] when applied to the port.

    If a procedure is supplied, it takes three arguments: the special
    value to write, a boolean that is @scheme[#f] if the procedure can
    buffer the special value and block indefinitely, and a boolean
    that is @scheme[#t] if the procedure should enable breaks while
    blocking. The result is one of the following:

     @itemize{

     @item{a non-event true value, which indicates that the special is
      written;}

     @item{@scheme[#f] if the special could not be written, perhaps
     because an internal buffer could not be completely flushed;}

     @item{a synchronizable event (see @secref["mz:sync"]) that acts like
     the result of @scheme[get-write-special-evt] to complete the write.}

     }

    Since @scheme[write-out-special] can return an event,
    passing the first argument to an implementation of
    @scheme[get-write-special-evt] is acceptable as an
    @scheme[write-out-special].

    As for @scheme[write-out], the @scheme[#f] result is discouraged,
    since it can lead to busy waiting. Also as for @scheme[write-out],
    an event produced by @scheme[write-out-special] is allowed
    to produce @scheme[#f] or another event like itself.  The
    @scheme[write-out-special] procedure is always called with
    breaks disabled, independent of whether breaks were enabled when
    the write was requested by a client of the port.}

   @item{@scheme[get-write-evt] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
   default) or a procedure of three arguments:

     @itemize{

     @item{an immutable byte string containing bytes to write;}

     @item{a non-negative exact integer for a starting offset
     (inclusive) into the byte string, and}

     @item{a non-negative exact integer for an ending offset
     (exclusive) into the byte string.}

     }

    The result is a synchronizable event (see @secref["mz:sync"]) to act as
    the result of @scheme[write-bytes-avail-evt] for the port (i.e.,
    to complete a write or flush), which becomes available only as
    data is committed to the port's underlying device, and whose
    result is the number of bytes written.

    If @scheme[get-write-evt] is @scheme[#f], then
    @scheme[port-writes-atomic?] will produce @scheme[#f] with applied
    to the port, and the port will not be a valid argument to
    procedures such as @scheme[write-bytes-avail-evt].

    Otherwise, an event returned by @scheme[get-write-evt] must
    not cause data to be written to the port unless the event is
    chosen in a synchronization, and it must write to the port if the
    event is chosen (i.e., the write must appear atomic with respect
    to the synchronization).

    If the event's result integer is larger than the supplied
    byte-string range, the @exnraise[exn:fail:contract] by a wrapper
    on the event. If the start and end indices are the same (i.e., no
    bytes are to be written), then the event should produce @scheme[0]
    when the buffer is completely flushed. (If the port has no buffer,
    then it is effectively always flushed.)

    If the event raises an exception, due either to write or commit
    operations, it must not have committed any new bytes (though it
    may have committed previously buffered bytes).

    Naturally, a port's events may be used in multiple threads
    simultaneously (if the port is accessible in multiple
    threads). The port is responsible for its own internal
    synchronization.}

  @item{@scheme[get-write-special-evt] --- either @scheme[#f]
    (the default), or a procedure to handle @scheme[write-special-evt]
    calls for the port. This argument must be @scheme[#f] if either
    @scheme[write-out-special] or @scheme[get-write-evt]
    is @scheme[#f], and it must be a procedure if both of those
    arguments are procedures.

    If it is a procedure, it takes one argument: the special value to
    write. The resulting event (with its constraints) is analogous to
    the result of @scheme[get-write-evt].

    If the event raises an exception, due either to write or commit
    operations, it must not have committed the special value (though
    it may have committed previously buffered bytes and values).}



  @item{@scheme[get-location] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default), or a procedure that takes no arguments and returns three
    values: the line number for the next item written to the port's
    stream (a positive number or @scheme[#f]), the column number for
    the next item written to port's stream (a non-negative number or
    @scheme[#f]), and the position for the next item written to port's
    stream (a positive number or @scheme[#f]). See also
    @secref["mz:linecol"].

    This procedure is only called if line counting is enabled for the
    port via @scheme[port-count-lines!] (in which case
    @scheme[count-lines!] is called).}

  @item{@scheme[count-lines!] --- a procedure of no arguments
    that is called if and when line counting is enabled for the port.
    The default procedure is @scheme[void].}

  @item{@scheme[init-position] --- an exact, positive integer that
    determines the position of the port's first output item, used when
    line counting is @italic{not} enabled for the port. The default is
    @scheme[1].}

  @item{@scheme[buffer-mode] --- either @scheme[#f] (the
    default) or a procedure that accepts zero or one arguments. If
    @scheme[buffer-mode] is @scheme[#f], then the resulting
    port does not support a buffer-mode setting. Otherwise, the
    procedure is called with one symbol argument (@scheme['block],
    @scheme['line], or @scheme['none]) to set the buffer mode, and it is
    called with zero arguments to get the current buffer mode. In the
    latter case, the result must be @scheme['block], @scheme['line],
    @scheme['none], or @scheme[#f] (unknown). See @secref["mz:port-buffers"]
    for more information on buffer modes.}
