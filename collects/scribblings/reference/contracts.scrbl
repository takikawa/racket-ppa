The contract system guards one part of a program from
another. Programmers specify the behavior of a module's exports via
@racket[(provide (contract-out ....))], and the contract system enforces those
constraints.

@deftech{Contracts} come in two forms: those constructed by the
various operations listed in this section of the manual, and various
ordinary Racket values that double as contracts, including
@itemize[
@item{@tech{symbols}, @tech{booleans}, @tech{characters}, @tech{keywords}, and
@racket[null], which are treated as contracts that recognize
themselves, using @racket[eq?], }

@item{@tech{strings} and @tech{byte strings}, which are treated as contracts
that recognize themselves using @racket[equal?], }

@item{@tech{numbers}, which are treated as contracts
that recognize themselves using @racket[=],}

@item{@tech{regular expressions}, which are treated as contracts
       that recognize @tech{byte strings} and @tech{strings} that
       match the regular expression, and }

@item{predicates: any procedure of arity 1 is treated as a
predicate. During contract checking, it is applied to the values that
appear and should return @racket[#f] to indicate that the contract
failed, and anything else to indicate it passed.}

]

Contracts in Racket are subdivided into three different categories:
@itemlist[@item{@deftech{Flat contract}s can be fully checked immediately for
                 a given value. These kinds of contracts are essentially
                 predicate functions. Using @racket[flat-contract-predicate],
                 you can extract the predicate from a flat contract, and
                 @racket[flat-contract?] recognizes a flat contract.}
          @item{@deftech{Chaperone contracts} are not always immediately
                 checkable, but are guaranteed to not change any properties
                 of any values that they check. That is, they may wrap
                 a value in such a way that it signals contract violations
                 later, as the value is used (e.g., a function contract
                 checks the inputs and outputs to the function only when
                 the function is called and returned), but any properties
                 that the value had before being wrapped by the contract
                 are preserved by the contract wrapper. 
                 
                 All flat contracts are also chaperone contracts (but
                 not vice-versa).}
         @item{@deftech{Impersonator contracts} do not provide any 
                guarantees about values they check. Impersonator contracts
                may hide properties of values, or even make them completely
                opaque (e.g, @racket[new-âˆ€/c]).
                
                All contracts are impersonator contracts.}]

For more about this hierarchy, see @tech{chaperones} and
a research paper on chaperones, impersonators, and how they can be used to 
implement contracts @cite{Strickland12}.

@section[#:tag "data-structure-contracts"]{Data-structure Contracts}
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/base]

@defproc[(flat-contract [predicate (any/c . -> . any/c)]) flat-contract?]{

Constructs a @tech{flat contract} from @racket[predicate]. A value
satisfies the contract if the predicate returns a true value.}


@defproc[(flat-named-contract [type-name any/c]
                              [predicate (or/c flat-contract? (any/c . -> . any))]
                              [generator (or/c #f (-> contract (-> int? any))) #f])
         flat-contract?]{

On predicates, behaves like @racket[flat-contract], but the first argument must be the
(quoted) name of a contract used for error reporting.
For example,
@racketblock[(flat-named-contract
              'odd-integer
              (lambda (x) (and (integer? x) (odd? x))))]
turns the predicate into a contract with the name @tt{odd-integer}.

On flat contracts, the new flat contract is the same as the old except for
the name.

The generator argument adds a generator for the flat-named-contract. See
@racket[contract-generate] for more information.
}

@defthing[any/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that accepts any value.

When using this contract as the result portion of a function contract,
consider using @racket[any] instead; using @racket[any] leads to
better memory performance, but it also allows multiple results.}


@defthing[none/c flat-contract?]{

A @tech{flat contract} that accepts no values.}


@defproc[(or/c [contract contract?] ...)
         contract?]{

Takes any number of contracts and returns
a contract that accepts any value that any one of the contracts
accepts individually.

The @racket[or/c] result tests any value by applying the contracts in
order, from left to right, with the exception that it always moves the
non-@tech{flat contracts} (if any) to the end, checking them
last. Thus, a contract such as @racket[(or/c (not/c real?)
positive?)] is guaranteed to only invoke the @racket[positive?]
predicate on real numbers.

If all of the arguments are procedures or @tech{flat contracts}, the
result is a @tech{flat contract}. If only one of the arguments is a
higher-order contract, the result is a contract that just checks the
flat contracts and, if they don't pass, applies the higher-order
contract.

If there are multiple higher-order contracts, @racket[or/c] uses
@racket[contract-first-order-passes?] to distinguish between
them. More precisely, when an @racket[or/c] is checked, it first
checks all of the @tech{flat contracts}. If none of them pass, it
calls @racket[contract-first-order-passes?] with each of the
higher-order contracts. If only one returns true, @racket[or/c] uses
that contract. If none of them return true, it signals a contract
violation. If more than one returns true, it also signals a contract
violation.
For example, this contract
@racketblock[
(or/c (-> number? number?)
      (-> string? string? string?))
]
does not accept a function like this one: @racket[(lambda args ...)]
since it cannot tell which of the two arrow contracts should be used
with the function.
}

@defproc[(and/c [contract (or/c contract? (any/c . -> . any/c))] ...)
         contract?]{

Takes any number of contracts and returns a contract that
accepts any value that satisfies all of the contracts simultaneously.

If all of the arguments are procedures or @tech{flat contracts},
the result is a @tech{flat contract}.

The contract produced by @racket[and/c] tests any value by applying
the contracts in order, from left to right.}


@defproc[(not/c [flat-contract (or/c flat-contract? (any/c . -> . any/c))])
         flat-contract?]{

Accepts a flat contracts or a predicate and returns a flat contract
that checks the inverse of the argument.}


@defproc[(=/c [z real?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be a number and
@racket[=] to @racket[z].}


@defproc[(</c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be a number and
@racket[<] than @racket[n].}


@defproc[(>/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[>].}


@defproc[(<=/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[<=].}


@defproc[(>=/c [n real?]) flat-contract?]{
Like @racket[</c], but for @racket[>=].}

@defproc[(between/c [n real?] [m real?])
flat-contract?]{ Returns a flat contract that requires the
input to be a real number between @racket[n] and @racket[m] or equal to
one of them.}

@defproc[(real-in [n real?] [m real?]) flat-contract?]{
An alias for @racket[between/c].}

@defproc[(integer-in [j exact-integer?] [k exact-integer?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that requires the input to be an exact integer
between @racket[j] and @racket[k], inclusive.}


@defthing[natural-number/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that requires the input to be an exact non-negative integer.}


@defproc[(string-len/c [len exact-nonnegative-integer?]) flat-contract?]{

Returns a flat contract that recognizes strings that have fewer than
@racket[len] characters.}


@defthing[false/c flat-contract?]{

An alias @racket[#f] for backwards compatibility.}


@defthing[printable/c flat-contract?]{

A flat contract that recognizes values that can be written out and
read back in with @racket[write] and @racket[read].}


@defproc[(one-of/c [v any/c] ...+) flat-contract?]{

Accepts any number of atomic values and returns a flat contract that
recognizes those values, using @racket[eqv?]  as the comparison
predicate.  For the purposes of @racket[one-of/c], atomic values are
defined to be: @tech{characters}, @tech{symbols}, @tech{booleans},
@racket[null], @tech{keywords}, @tech{numbers},
@|void-const|, and @|undefined-const|.

This is a backwards compatibility contract constructor. If
neither @|void-const| nor @|undefined-const| are arguments,
it simply passes its arguments to @racket[or/c].
}


@defproc[(symbols [sym symbol?] ...+) flat-contract?]{

Accepts any number of symbols and returns a flat contract that
recognizes those symbols.

This is a backwards compatibility constructor; it merely
passes its arguments to @racket[or/c].
}

@defproc[(vectorof [c contract?]
                   [#:immutable immutable (or/c #t #f 'dont-care) 'dont-care]
                   [#:flat? flat? boolean? #f])
         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes vectors. The elements of the vector must
match @racket[c].

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] argument must also be a flat contract.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable vectors, as they will not
check future operations on the vector.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] argument is
a flat contract, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] argument
is a chaperone contract, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[vectorof] contract is applied to a vector, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable vectors
and a @tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable vectors.}


@defproc[(vector-immutableof [c contract?]) contract?]{

Returns the same contract as @racket[(vectorof c #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
backwards compatibility.}

@defproc[(vector/c [c contract?] ...
                   [#:immutable immutable (or/c #t #f 'dont-care) 'dont-care]
                   [#:flat? flat? boolean? #f])
         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes vectors whose lengths match the number of
contracts given. Each element of the vector must match its corresponding contract.

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] arguments must also be flat contracts.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable vectors, as they will not
check future operations on the vector.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] arguments are
flat contracts, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] arguments
are chaperone contracts, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[vector/c] contract is applied to a vector, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable vectors
and a @tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable vectors.}


@defproc[(vector-immutable/c [c contract?] ...) contract?]{

Returns the same contract as @racket[(vector/c c ... #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
reasons of backwards compatibility.}


@defproc[(box/c [c contract?]
                [#:immutable immutable (or/c #t #f 'dont-care) 'dont-care]
                [#:flat? flat? boolean? #f])
         contract?]{
Returns a contract that recognizes boxes. The content of the box must match @racket[c].

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[c] argument must also be a flat contract.  Such
flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable boxes, as they will not check
future operations on the box.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[c] argument is
a flat contract, the result will be a flat contract.  If the @racket[c] argument is
a chaperone contract, then the result will be a chaperone contract.

When a higher-order @racket[box/c] contract is applied to a box, the result
is not @racket[eq?] to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable boxes
and either a @tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable boxes.}


@defproc[(box-immutable/c [c contract?]) contract?]{

Returns the same contract as @racket[(box/c c #:immutable #t)]. This form exists for
reasons of backwards compatibility.}


@defproc[(listof [c (or/c contract? (any/c . -> . any/c))]) contract?]{

Returns a contract that recognizes a list whose every element matches
the contract @racket[c]. Beware that when this contract is applied to
a value, the result is not necessarily @racket[eq?] to the input.}


@defproc[(non-empty-listof [c (or/c contract? (any/c . -> . any/c))]) contract?]{

Returns a contract that recognizes non-empty lists whose elements match
the contract @racket[c]. Beware that when this contract is applied to
a value, the result is not necessarily @racket[eq?] to the input.}

@defproc[(cons/c [car-c contract?] [cdr-c contract?]) contract?]{

Produces a contract that recognizes pairs whose first and second elements
match @racket[car-c] and @racket[cdr-c], respectively. Beware that
when this contract is applied to a value, the result is not
necessarily @racket[eq?] to the input.}


@defproc[(list/c [c (or/c contract? (any/c . -> . any/c))] ...) contract?]{

Produces a contract for a list. The number of elements in the list
must match the number of arguments supplied to @racket[list/c], and
each element of the list must match the corresponding contract. Beware
that when this contract is applied to a value, the result is not
necessarily @racket[eq?] to the input.}


@defproc[(syntax/c [c flat-contract?]) flat-contract?]{

Produces a flat contract that recognizes syntax objects whose
@racket[syntax-e] content matches @racket[c].}


@defform[(struct/c struct-id contract-expr ...)]{
Produces a contract that recognizes instances of the structure
type named by @racket[struct-id], and whose field values match the
contracts produced by the @racket[contract-expr]s.

Contracts for immutable fields must be either flat or chaperone contracts.
Contracts for mutable fields may be impersonator contracts.
If all fields are immutable and the @racket[contract-expr]s evaluate
to flat contracts, a flat contract is produced.  If all the
@racket[contract-expr]s are chaperone contracts, a chaperone contract is
produced.  Otherwise, an impersonator contract is produced.
}


@defform/subs[(struct/dc struct-id field-spec ...)
              ([field-spec [field-name maybe-lazy contract-expr]

               [maybe-dep-state (code:line) #:depends-on-state])]{
Produces a contract that recognizes instances of the structure
type named by @racket[struct-id], and whose field values match the
contracts produced by the @racket[field-spec]s.

If the @racket[field-spec] lists the names of other fields,
then the contract depends on values in those fields, and the @racket[contract-expr]
expression is evaluated each time a selector is applied, building a new contract
for the fields based on the values of the @racket[dep-field-name] fields (the
@racket[dep-field-name] syntax is the same as the @racket[field-name] syntax).
If the field is a dependent field, then it is assumed that the contract is
a chaperone, but not always a flat contract (and theus the entire @racket[struct/dc]
contract is not a flat contract).
If this is not the case, and the contract is
always flat then the field must be annotated with
the @racket[#:flat], or the field must be annotated with
@racket[#:chaperone] (in which case, it must be a mutable field).

If the @racket[#:lazy] keyword appears, then the contract
on the field is check lazily (only when a selector is applied);
@racket[#:lazy] contracts cannot be put on mutable fields.

If a dependent contract depends on some mutable state, then use the
@racket[#:depends-on-state] keyword argument (if a field's dependent contract
depends on a mutable field, this keyword is automatically inferred).
The presence of this keyword means that the contract expression is evaluated
each time the corresponding field is accessed (or mutated, if it is a mutable
field). Otherwise, the contract expression for a dependent field contract
is evaluated when the contract is applied to a value.

Contracts for immutable fields must be either flat or chaperone contracts.
Contracts for mutable fields may be impersonator contracts.
If all fields are immutable and the @racket[contract-expr]s evaluate
to flat contracts, a flat contract is produced.  If all the
@racket[contract-expr]s are chaperone contracts, a chaperone contract is
produced.  Otherwise, an impersonator contract is produced.

As an example, the function @racket[bst/c] below
returns a contract for binary search trees whose values
are all between @racket[lo] and @racket[hi].
The lazy annotations ensure that this contract does not
change the running time of operations that do not
inspect the entire tree.

@racketblock[(struct bt (val left right))
             (define (bst/c lo hi)
               (or/c #f
                     (struct/dc bt
                                [val (between/c lo hi)]
                                [left (val) #:lazy (bst lo val)]
                                [right (val) #:lazy (bst val hi)])))]

}


@defproc[(parameter/c [c contract?]) contract?]{

Produces a contract on parameters whose values must match
@racket[contract].}

         contract?]{
Produces a contract that recognizes @racket[hash] tables with keys and values
as specified by the @racket[key] and @racket[val] arguments.

If the @racket[flat?] argument is @racket[#t], then the resulting contract is
a flat contract, and the @racket[key] and @racket[val] arguments must also be flat
contracts.  Such flat contracts will be unsound if applied to mutable hash tables,
as they will not check future operations on the hash table.

If the @racket[immutable] argument is @racket[#t] and the @racket[key] and
@racket[val] arguments are flat contracts, the result will be a flat contract.
If either the domain or the range is a chaperone contract, then the result will
be a chaperone contract.

If the @racket[key] argument is a chaperone contract, then the resulting contract
can only be applied to @racket[equal?]-based hash tables.  When a higher-order
@racket[hash/c] contract is applied to a hash table, the result is not @racket[eq?]
to the input.  The result will be a copy for immutable hash tables, and either a
@tech{chaperone} or @tech{impersonator} of the input for mutable hash tables.

@defproc[(prompt-tag/c [contract contract?] ...) contract?]{
Takes any number of contracts and returns a contract that recognizes
continuation prompt tags and will check any aborts or prompt handlers that
use the contracted prompt tag.

Each @racket[contract] will check the corresponding value passed to
an @racket[abort-current-continuation] and handled by the handler of a
call to @racket[call-with-continuation-prompt].

If all of the @racket[contract]s are chaperone contracts, the resulting
contract will also be a @tech{chaperone} contract. Otherwise, the contract is
an @tech{impersonator} contract.

@defproc[(continuation-mark-key/c [contract contract?]) contract?]{
Takes a single contract and returns a contract that recognizes
continuation marks and will check any mappings of marks to values
or any accesses of the mark value.

If the argument @racket[contract] is a chaperone contract, the resulting
contract will also be a @tech{chaperone} contract. Otherwise, the contract is

@defform[(flat-rec-contract id flat-contract-expr ...)]{

Constructs a recursive @tech{flat contract}. A
@racket[flat-contract-expr] can refer to @racket[id] to refer
recursively to the generated contract.

For example, the contract

@racketblock[
   (flat-rec-contract sexp
     (cons/c sexp sexp)
     number?
     symbol?)
]

is a flat contract that checks for (a limited form of)
S-expressions. It says that a @racket[sexp] is either two
@racket[sexp]s combined with @racket[cons], or a number, or a symbol.

Note that if the contract is applied to a circular value, contract
checking will not terminate.}


@defform[(flat-murec-contract ([id flat-contract-expr ...] ...) body ...+)]{

A generalization of @racket[flat-rec-contract] for defining several
mutually recursive flat contracts simultaneously. Each @racket[id] is
visible in the entire @racket[flat-murec-contract] form, and the
result of the final @racket[body] is the result of the entire form.}


@defidform[any]{

Represents a contract that is always satisfied. In particular, it can accept
multiple values.  It can only be used in a result position of contracts like
@racket[->]. Using @racket[any] elsewhere is a syntax error.}

@defform[(promise/c expr)]{

Constructs a contract on a promise. The contract does not force the
promise, but when the promise is forced, the contract checks that the
result value meets the contract produced by @racket[expr].}

@section[#:tag "function-contracts"]{Function Contracts}
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/base]

A @deftech{function contract} wraps a procedure to delay
checks for its arguments and results. There are three
primary function contract combinators that have increasing
amounts of expressiveness and increasing additional
overheads. The first @racket[->] is the cheapest. It
generates wrapper functions that can call the original
function directly. Contracts built with @racket[->*] require
packaging up arguments as lists in the wrapper function and
then using either @racket[keyword-apply] or
@racket[apply]. Finally, @racket[->i]
is the most expensive (along with @racket[->d]),
because it requires delaying the evaluation of the contract
expressions for the domain and range until the function
itself is called or returns.

The @racket[case->] contract is a specialized contract,
designed to match @racket[case-lambda] and
@racket[unconstrained-domain->] allows range checking
without requiring that the domain have any particular shape
(see below for an example use).

@defform*/subs[#:literals (any values)
               [(-> dom ... range)]
               ([dom dom-expr (code:line keyword dom-expr)]
                [range range-expr (values range-expr ...) any])]{

Produces a contract for a function that accepts a fixed
number of arguments and returns either a fixed number of
results or completely unspecified results (the latter when
@racket[any] is specified).

Each @racket[dom-expr] is a contract on an argument to a
function, and each @racket[range-expr] is a contract on a
result of the function.

@margin-note{Using a @racket[->] between two whitespace-delimited
@racketparenfont{.}s is the same as putting the @racket[->] right
after the enclosing opening parenthesis. See
@guidesecref["lists-and-syntax"] or @secref["parse-pair"] for more
information.}

For example,

@racketblock[(integer? boolean? . -> . integer?)]

produces a contract on functions of two arguments. The first argument
must be an integer, and the second argument must be a boolean. The
function must produce an integer.

A domain specification may include a keyword. If so, the function must
accept corresponding (mandatory) keyword arguments, and the values for
the keyword arguments must match the corresponding contracts. For
example:

@racketblock[(integer? #:x boolean? . -> . integer?)]

is a contract on a function that accepts a by-position argument that
is an integer and a @racket[#:x] argument that is a boolean.

If @racket[any] is used as the last sub-form for @racket[->], no
contract checking is performed on the result of the function, and
thus any number of values is legal (even different numbers on different
invocations of the function).

If @racket[(values range-expr ...)] is used as the last sub-form of
@racket[->], the function must produce a result for each contract, and
each value must match its respective contract.}

The @racket[->*] contract combinator produces contracts for functions
that accept optional arguments (either keyword or positional) and/or
arbitrarily many arguments. The first clause of a @racket[->*]
contract describes the mandatory arguments, and is similar to the
argument description of a @racket[->] contract. The second clause
describes the optional arguments. The range of description can either
be @racket[any] or a sequence of contracts, indicating that the
function must return multiple values.

If present, the
@racket[rest-expr] contract governs the arguments in the rest
parameter. Note that the @racket[rest-expr] contract governs only
the arguments in the rest parameter, not those in mandatory arguments.
For example, this contract:
@racketblock[(->* () #:rest (cons/c integer? (listof integer?)) any)]
does not match the function
@racketblock[(Î» (x . rest) x)]
because the contract insists that the function accept zero arguments
(because there are no mandatory arguments listed in the contract). The
@racket[->i] contract does not know that the contract on the rest argument is
going to end up disallowing empty argument lists.

The @racket[pre-cond-expr] and @racket[post-cond-expr]
expressions are checked as the function is called and returns,
respectively, and allow checking of the environment without an
explicit connection to an argument (or a result).

As an example, the contract
@racketblock[(->* () (boolean? #:x integer?) #:rest (listof symbol?) symbol?)]
matches functions that optionally accept a boolean, an
integer keyword argument @racket[#:x] and arbitrarily more
symbols, and that return a symbol.

The @racket[->i] contract combinator differs from the @racket[->*]
combinator in that the support pre- and post-condition clauses and
in that each argument and result is named. These names can then
be used in the subcontracts and in the pre-/post-condition clauses.
In short, contracts now express dependencies among arguments and results.

The first sub-form of a @racket[->i] contract covers the mandatory and the
second sub-form covers the optional arguments. Following that is an optional
rest-args contract, and an optional pre-condition. The pre-condition is
introduced with the @racket[#:pre] keyword followed by the list of names on
which it depends. If the @racket[#:pre/name] keyword is used, the string
supplied is used as part of the error message; similarly with @racket[#:post/name].

The @racket[dep-range] non-terminal specifies the possible result
contracts. If it is @racket[any], then any value is allowed. Otherwise, the
result contract pairs a name and a contract or a multiple values return
with names and contracts. In the last two cases, the range contract may be
optionally followed by a post-condition; the post-condition expression is
not allowed if the range contract is @racket[any]. Like the pre-condition,
the post-condition must specify the variables on which it depends.

Consider this sample contract:
@racketblock[(->i ([x number?]
                   [y (x) (>=/c x)])
                  [result (x y) (and/c number? (>=/c (+ x y)))])]
It specifies a function of two arguments, both numbers. The contract on the
second argument (@racket[y]) demands that it is greater than the first
argument. The result contract promises a number that is greater than the
sum of the two arguments. While the dependency specification for @racket[y]
signals that the argument contract depends on the value of the first
argument, the dependency sequence for @racket[result] indicates that the
contract depends on both argument values. @margin-note*{In general, an
empty sequence is (nearly) equivalent to not adding
a sequence at all except that the former is more expensive than the latter.}
Since the contract for @racket[x] does not depend on anything else, it does
not come with any dependency sequence, not even @racket[()].

The contract expressions are not always evaluated in
order. First, if there is no dependency for a given contract expression,
the contract expression is evaluated at the time that the @racket[->i]
expression is evaluated rather than the time when the function is called or
returns.  These dependency-free contract expressions are evaluated in the
order in which they are listed.
@;
Second, the dependent contract sub-expressions are evaluated when the
contracted function is called or returns in some order that satisfies the
dependencies. That is, if a contract for an argument depends on the value
of some other contract, the former is evaluated first (so that the
argument, with its contract checked, is available for the other).  When
there is no dependency between two arguments (or the result and an
argument), then the contract that appears earlier in the source text is
evaluated first.

Finally, if all of the identifier positions of the range
contract are @racket[_]s (underscores), then the range contract expressions
are evaluated when the function is called and the underscore is not bound
in the range, after the argument contracts are evaluated and
checked. Otherwise, the range expressions are evaluated when the function
returns.

If there are optional arguments that are not supplied, then
the corresponding variables will be bound to a special value
called @racket[the-unsupplied-arg] value.

@defform[(unconstrained-domain-> range-expr ...)]{

@racketblock[

          ()
          [_ number?])]))
]

says that the function @racket[f] accepts a natural number
and a function. The domain of the function that @racket[f]
accepts must include a case for @racket[size] arguments,
meaning that @racket[f] can safely supply @racket[size]
arguments to its input.

For example, the following is a definition of @racket[f] that cannot
be blamed using the above contract:

@racketblock[

@section[#:tag "parametric-contracts"]{Parametric Contracts}
@defmodule*/no-declare[(racket/contract/parametric)]
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/parametric]

The most convenient way to use parametric contract is to use
@racket[contract-out]'s @racket[#:exists] keyword.
The @racketmodname[racket/contract/parametric] provides a few more,
general-purpose parametric contracts.

@defform[(parametric->/c (x ...) c)]{

Creates a contract for parametric polymorphic functions.  Each function is
protected by @racket[c], where each @racket[x] is bound in @racket[c] and refers
to a polymorphic type that is instantiated each time the function is applied.

At each application of a function, the @racket[parametric->/c] contract constructs
a new opaque wrapper for each @racket[x]; values flowing into the polymorphic
function (i.e. values protected by some @racket[x] in negative position with
respect to @racket[parametric->/c]) are wrapped in the corresponding opaque
wrapper.  Values flowing out of the polymorphic function (i.e. values protected
by some @racket[x] in positive position with respect to @racket[parametric->/c])
are checked for the appropriate wrapper.  If they have it, they are unwrapped;
if they do not, a contract violation is signaled.

@examples[#:eval (contract-eval)
(define/contract (check x y)
  (parametric->/c [X] (boolean? X . -> . X))
  (if (or (not x) (equal? y 'surprise))
      'invalid
      y))
(check #t 'ok)
(check #f 'ignored)
(check #t 'surprise)
]
}

@defproc[(new-âˆ€/c [name symbol?]) contract?]{
  Constructs a new universal contract.

  Universal contracts accept all values when in negative positions (e.g., function
  inputs) and wrap them in an opaque struct, hiding the precise value.
  In positive positions (e.g. function returns),
  a universal contract accepts only values that were previously accepted
  in negative positions (by checking for the wrappers).

  The name is used to identify the contract in error messages.

  For example, this contract:
  @racketblock[(let ([a (new-âˆ€/c 'a)])
                 (-> a a))]
  describes the identity function (or a non-terminating function)
  That is, the first use of the @racket[a] appears in a
  negative position and thus inputs to that function are wrapped with an opaque struct.
  Then, when the function returns, it is checked to determine whether the result is wrapped, since
  the second @racket[a] appears in a positive position.

  The @racket[new-âˆ€/c] construct constructor is dual to @racket[new-âˆƒ/c].

}

@defproc[(new-âˆƒ/c [name symbol?]) contract?]{
  Constructs a new existential contract.

  Existential contracts accept all values when in positive positions (e.g., function
  returns) and wrap them in an opaque struct, hiding the precise value.
  In negative positions (e.g. function inputs),
  they accepts only values that were previously accepted in positive positions (by checking
  for the wrappers).

  The name is used to identify the contract in error messages.

  For example, this contract:
  @racketblock[(let ([a (new-âˆƒ/c 'a)])
                 (-> (-> a a)
                     any/c))]
  describes a function that accepts the identity function (or a non-terminating function)
  and returns an arbitrary value. That is, the first use of the @racket[a] appears in a
  positive position and thus inputs to that function are wrapped with an opaque struct.
  Then, when the function returns, it is checked to see if the result is wrapped, since
  the second @racket[a] appears in a negative position.

  The @racket[new-âˆƒ/c] construct constructor is dual to @racket[new-âˆ€/c].

on the structs, but the contracts on later fields may depend on the
values of earlier fields.

The generated contract combinators are @italic{lazy}: they only verify
the contract holds for the portion of some data structure that is
actually inspected. More precisely, a lazy data structure contract is
not checked until a selector extracts a field of a struct.

the same @tech{phase level} as the @racket[provide] form; for example,
@racket[contract-out] cannot be nested within @racket[for-syntax]). Each @racket[id]
is provided from the module. In
addition, clients of the module must live up to the contract specified
by @racket[contract-expr] for each export.

The @racket[contract-out] form treats modules as units of
blame. The module that defines the provided variable is expected to
meet the positive (co-variant) positions of the contract. Each module
that imports the provided variable must obey the negative
(contra-variant) positions of the contract. Each @racket[contract-expr]
in a @racket[contract-out] form is effectively moved to the end of the
enclosing module, so a @racket[contract-expr] can refer to variables
that are defined later in the same module.

Only uses of the contracted variable outside the module are
checked. Inside the module, no contract checking occurs.

The @racket[rename] form of @racket[contract-out] exports the
first variable (the internal name) with the name specified by the
second variable (the external name).

The @racket[struct] form of @racket[contract-out]
provides a structure-type definition, and each field has a contract
that dictates the contents of the fields. The structure-type
definition must appear before the @racket[provide] clause within the
enclosing module. If the structure type has a parent, the second
@racket[struct] form (above) must be used, with the first name
referring to the structure type to export and the second name
referring to the parent structure type. Unlike a @racket[struct]
definition, however, all of the fields (and their contracts) must be
listed. The contract on the fields that the sub-struct shares with its
parent are only used in the contract for the sub-struct's constructor, and
the selector or mutators for the super-struct are not provided. The
exported structure-type name always doubles as a constructor, even if
the original structure-type name does not act as a constructor.

The @racket[#:âˆƒ], @racket[#:exists], @racket[#:âˆ€], and @racket[#:forall]
clauses define new abstract contracts. The variables are bound in the
remainder of the @racket[contract-out] form to new contracts that hide
the values they accept and ensure that the exported functions are treated
parametrically. See @racket[new-âˆƒ/c] and @racket[new-âˆ€/c] for details
on how the clauses hide the values.

The implementation of @racket[contract-out] attaches uses
@racket[syntax-property] to attach properties to the code it generates
that records the syntax of the contracts in the fully expanded program.
Specifically, the symbol @racket['provide/contract-original-contract]
is bound to vectors of two elements, the exported identifier and a
syntax object for the expression that produces the contract controlling
the export.

The primitive mechanism for attaching a contract to a value. The

The @racket[contract] expression adds the contract specified by

@racket[to-protect-expr]. The result of a @racket[contract] expression
is the result of the @racket[to-protect-expr] expression, but with the

@section{Building New Contract Combinators}

@defmodule*/no-declare[(racket/contract/combinator)]
@declare-exporting-ctc[racket/contract/combinator]

Contracts are represented internally as functions that
accept information about the contract (who is to blame,
source locations, @|etc|) and produce projections (in the
spirit of Dana Scott) that enforce the contract. A
projection is a function that accepts an arbitrary value,
and returns a value that satisfies the corresponding
contract. For example, a projection that accepts only
integers corresponds to the contract @racket[(flat-contract
integer?)], and can be written like this:

@racketblock[
(define int-proj
  (lambda (x)
    (if (integer? x)
        x
        (signal-contract-violation))))
]

As a second example, a projection that accepts unary functions
on integers looks like this:

@racketblock[
(define int->int-proj
  (lambda (f)
    (if (and (procedure? f)
             (procedure-arity-includes? f 1))
        (lambda (x)
          (int-proj (f (int-proj x))))
        (signal-contract-violation))))
]

Although these projections have the right error behavior,
they are not quite ready for use as contracts, because they
do not accommodate blame, and do not provide good error
messages. In order to accommodate these, contracts do not
just use simple projections, but use functions that accept a
@deftech{blame object} encapsulating
the names of two parties that are the candidates for blame,
as well as a record of the source location where the
contract was established and the name of the contract. They
can then, in turn, pass that information
to @racket[raise-blame-error] to signal a good error
message.

Here is the first of those two projections, rewritten for
use in the contract system:
@racketblock[
(define (int-proj blame)
  (lambda (x)
    (if (integer? x)
        x
        (raise-blame-error
         blame
         val
         '(expected: "<integer>" given: "~e")
         val))))
]
The new argument specifies who is to be blamed for
positive and negative contract violations.

Contracts, in this system, are always
established between two parties. One party provides some
value according to the contract, and the other consumes the
value, also according to the contract. The first is called
the ``positive'' person and the second the ``negative''. So,
in the case of just the integer contract, the only thing
that can go wrong is that the value provided is not an
integer. Thus, only the positive party can ever accrue
blame.  The @racket[raise-blame-error] function always blames
the positive party.

Compare that to the projection for our function contract:

@racketblock[
(define (int->int-proj blame)
  (let ([dom (int-proj (blame-swap blame))]
        [rng (int-proj blame)])
    (lambda (f)
      (if (and (procedure? f)
               (procedure-arity-includes? f 1))
          (lambda (x)
            (rng (f (dom x))))
          (raise-blame-error
           blame
           val
           '(expected "a procedure of one argument" given: "~e")
           val)))))
]

In this case, the only explicit blame covers the situation
where either a non-procedure is supplied to the contract or
the procedure does not accept one argument. As with
the integer projection, the blame here also lies with the
producer of the value, which is
why @racket[raise-blame-error] is passed @racket[blame] unchanged.

The checking for the domain and range are delegated to
the @racket[int-proj] function, which is supplied its
arguments in the first two lines of
the @racket[int->int-proj] function. The trick here is that,
even though the @racket[int->int-proj] function always
blames what it sees as positive, we can swap the blame parties by
calling @racket[blame-swap] on the given @tech{blame object}, replacing
the positive party with the negative party and vice versa.

This technique is not merely a cheap trick to get the example to work,
however. The reversal of the positive and the negative is a
natural consequence of the way functions behave. That is,
imagine the flow of values in a program between two
modules. First, one module defines a function, and then that
module is required by another. So, far the function itself
has to go from the original, providing module to the
requiring module. Now, imagine that the providing module
invokes the function, supplying it an argument. At this
point, the flow of values reverses. The argument is
traveling back from the requiring module to the providing
module! And finally, when the function produces a result,
that result flows back in the original
direction. Accordingly, the contract on the domain reverses
the positive and the negative blame parties, just like the flow
of values reverses.

We can use this insight to generalize the function contracts
and build a function that accepts any two contracts and
returns a contract for functions between them.

This projection also goes further and uses
@racket[blame-add-context] to improve the error messages
when a contract violation is detected.

@racketblock[
(define (make-simple-function-contract dom-proj range-proj)
  (lambda (blame)
    (let ([dom (dom-proj (blame-add-context blame "the argument of" #:swap? #t))]
          [rng (range-proj (blame-add-context blame "the range of"))])
      (lambda (f)
        (if (and (procedure? f)
                 (procedure-arity-includes? f 1))
            (lambda (x)
              (rng (f (dom x))))
            (raise-blame-error
             blame
             val
             '(expected "a procedure of one argument" given: "~e")
             val))))))
]

These functions build simple higher-order contracts, chaperone contracts, and flat contracts,
respectively.  They both take the same set of three optional arguments: a name,
a first-order predicate, and a blame-tracking projection.

The @racket[name] argument is any value to be rendered using @racket[display] to
describe the contract when a violation occurs.  The default name for simple
higher-order contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-contract], for chaperone
contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-chaperone-contract], and for flat
contracts is @racketresult[anonymous-flat-contract].

The first-order predicate @racket[test] can be used to determine which values
the contract applies to; usually, this is the set of values for which the
contract fails immediately without any higher-order wrapping.  This test is used
by @racket[contract-first-order-passes?], and indirectly by @racket[or/c] to
determine which of multiple higher-order contracts to wrap a value with.  The
default test accepts any value.

The projection @racket[proj] defines the behavior of applying the contract.  It
is a curried function of two arguments: the first application accepts a blame
object, and the second accepts a value to protect with the contract.  The
projection must either produce the value, suitably wrapped to enforce any
higher-order aspects of the contract, or signal a contract violation using
@racket[raise-blame-error].  The default projection produces an error when the
first-order test fails, and produces the value unchanged otherwise.

Projections for chaperone contracts must produce a value that passes
@racket[chaperone-of?] when compared with the original, uncontracted value.
Projections for flat contracts must fail precisely when the first-order test
does, and must produce the input value unchanged otherwise.  Applying a flat
contract may result in either an application of the predicate, or the
projection, or both; therefore, the two must be consistent.  The existence of a
separate projection only serves to provide more specific error messages.  Most
flat contracts do not need to supply an explicit projection.

The @racket[stronger] argument is used to implement @racket[contract-stronger?]. The
first argument is always the contract itself and the second argument is whatever
was passed as the second argument to @racket[contract-stronger?].

  Adds some context information to blame error messages
  that explicates which portion of the contract failed
  (and that gets rendered by @racket[raise-blame-error]).

  The @racket[context] argument describes one layer of the
  portion of the contract, typically of the form @racket["the 1st argument of"]
  (in the case of a function contract)
  or @racket["a conjunct of"] (in the case of an @racket[and/c] contract).

  For example, consider this contract violation:
  @interaction[#:eval (contract-eval)
(define/contract f
  (list/c (-> integer? integer?))
  (list (Î» (x) x)))

((car f) #f)
]
It shows that the portion of the contract being violated is the first
occurrence of @racket[integer?], because the @racket[->] and
the @racket[list/c] combinators each internally called
@racket[blame-add-context] to add the two lines following
``in'' in the error message.

The @racket[important] argument is used to build the beginning part
of the contract violation. The last @racket[important] argument that
gets added to a blame object is used. The @racket[class/c] contract
adds an important argument, as does the @racket[->] contract (when
@racket[->] knows the name of the function getting the contract).

The @racket[swap?] argument has the effect of calling @racket[blame-swap]
while adding the layer of context, but without creating an extra
blame object.

The context information recorded in blame structs keeps track of
combinators that do not add information, and add the string @racket["..."]
for them, so programmers at least see that there was some context
they are missing in the error messages. Accordingly, since there are
combinators that should not add any context (e.g., @racket[recursive-contract]),
passing @racket[#f] as the context string argument avoids adding the
@racket["..."] string.

These functions build the arguments for @racket[prop:contract],
@racket[prop:chaperone-contract], and @racket[prop:flat-contract], respectively.

A @deftech{contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure when used as
a contract.  It is specified in terms of five accessors: @racket[get-name],
which produces a description to @racket[write] as part of a contract violation;
@racket[get-first-order], which produces a first-order predicate to be used by
@racket[contract-first-order-passes?]; @racket[get-projection], which
produces a blame-tracking projection defining the behavior of the contract;
@racket[stronger], which is a predicate that determines whether this contract
(passed in the first argument) is stronger than some other contract (passed
in the second argument); and @racket[generator], which makes a random value
that matches the contract, given a size bound and an environment from which
to draw interesting values.

These accessors are passed as (optional) keyword arguments to
@racket[build-contract-property], and are applied to instances of the
appropriate structure type by the contract system.  Their results are used
analogously to the arguments of @racket[make-contract].

A @deftech{chaperone contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure
when used as a chaperone contract.  It is specified using
@racket[build-chaperone-contract-property], and accepts exactly the same set of
arguments as @racket[build-contract-property].  The only difference is that the
projection accessor must return a value that passes @racket[chaperone-of?] when
compared with the original, uncontracted value.

A @deftech{flat contract property} specifies the behavior of a structure when
used as a flat contract.  It is specified using
@racket[build-flat-contract-property], and accepts exactly the same set of
arguments as @racket[build-contract-property].  The only difference is that the
projection accessor is expected not to wrap its argument in a higher-order
fashion, analogous to the constraint on projections in
@racket[make-flat-contract].

@subsection{Obligation Information in Check Syntax}

@seclink[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/drracket/drracket.scrbl")
"buttons"]{Check Syntax} in DrRacket shows obligation information for
contracts according to @racket[syntax-property]s that the contract combinators
leave in the expanded form of the program. These properties indicate
where contracts appear in the source and where the positive and negative
positions of the contracts appear.

To make Check Syntax show obligation information for your new contract
combinators, use the following properties (some helper macros and functions
are below):

@itemize[@item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:contract :
                             (vector/c symbol? (listof syntax?) (listof syntax?))]
                This property should be attached to the result of a transformer
                that implements a contract combinator. It signals to Check Syntax
                that this is where a contract begins.

                The first element in the
                vector should be a unique (in the sense of @racket[eq?]) value
                that Check Syntax can use a tag to match up this contract with
                its subpieces (specified by the two following syntax properties).

                The second and third elements of the vector are syntax objects
                from pieces of the contract, and Check Syntax will color them.
                The first list should contain subparts that are the responsibility
                of parties (typically modules) that provide implementations of the contract.
                The second list should contain subparts that are the
                responsibility of clients.

                For example, in @racket[(->* () #:pre #t any/c #:post #t)],
                the @racket[->*] and the @racket[#:post] should be in the first
                list and @racket[#:pre] in the second list.}

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:negative-position : symbol?]
                 This property should be attached to sub-expressions of
                 a contract combinator that are expected to be other contracts.
                 The value of the property should be the key (the first element from
                 the vector for the @racket['racket/contract:contract] property)
                 indicating which contract this is.

                 This property should be used when the expression's value is a contract
                 that clients are responsible for. }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:positive-position : symbol?]
                 This form is just like @racket['racket/contract:negative-position],
                 except that it should be used when the expression's value is
                 a contract that the original party should be responsible for.
                 }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:contract-on-boundary : symbol?]
                 The presence of this property tells Check Syntax that it
                 should start coloring from this point. It expects the expression
                 to be a contract
                 (and, thus, to have the @racket['racket/contract:contract] property);
                 this property indicates that this contract is on a (module) boundary.

                 (The value of the property is not used.)
                 }

          @item{@racketblock0['racket/contract:internal-contract : symbol?]

                 Like @racket['racket/contract:contract-on-boundary], the presence
                 of this property triggers coloring, but this is meant for use
                 when the party (module) containing the contract (regardless of whether
                 or not this module exports anything matching the contract)
                 can be blamed for violating the contract. This comes into play
                 for @racket[->i] contracts, since the contract itself has
                 access to values under contract via the dependency.

If it returns @racket[#f], the contract is guaranteed not to
hold for that value; if it returns @racket[#t], the contract

can be used as a contract) and @racket[#f] otherwise.}

@defproc[(chaperone-contract? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

it returns a value which passes @racket[chaperone-of?] when compared to
the original, uncontracted value.}

Returns @racket[#t] if its argument is a contract that is not a chaperone
contract nor a flat contract.}

@defproc[(flat-contract? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] when its argument is a contract that can be
checked immediately (unlike, say, a function contract).

For example,
@racket[flat-contract] constructs flat contracts from predicates, and
symbols, booleans, numbers, and other ordinary Racket values
(that are defined as @tech{contracts}) are also
flat contracts.}

  in your own contract combinators, use @racket[prop:contracted] or
  @racket[impersonator-prop:contracted].
}

@defproc[(has-contract? [v any/c]) boolean?]{
  Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] is a value that
  has a recorded contract attached to it.

  See also @racket[value-contract].

@defproc[(contract-projection [c contract?]) (-> blame? (-> any/c any/c))]{
Produces the projection defining a contract's behavior on protected values.
}

@defproc[(make-none/c [sexp-name any/c]) contract?]{

Makes a contract that accepts no values, and reports the
name @racket[sexp-name] when signaling a contract violation.}

@defform*[[(recursive-contract contract-expr)
           (recursive-contract contract-expr type)]]{

Delays the evaluation of its argument until the contract is checked,
making recursive contracts possible.  If @racket[type] is given, it
describes the expected type of contract and must be one of the keywords
@racket[#:impersonator], @racket[#:chaperone], or @racket[#:flat].  If
@racket[type] is not given, an impersonator contract is created.}


@defform[(opt/c contract-expr)]{

This optimizes its argument contract expression by
traversing its syntax and, for known contract combinators,
fuses them into a single contract combinator that avoids as
much allocation overhead as possible. The result is a
contract that should behave identically to its argument,
except faster (due to less allocation).}


@defform[(define-opt/c (id id ...) expr)]{

This defines a recursive contract and simultaneously
optimizes it. Semantically, it behaves just as if
the @racket[-opt/c] were not present, defining a function on
contracts (except that the body expression must return a
contract). But, it also optimizes that contract definition,
avoiding extra allocation, much like @racket[opt/c] does.

For example,

@racketblock[
(define-contract-struct bt (val left right))

(define-opt/c (bst-between/c lo hi)
  (or/c null?
        (bt/c [val (real-in lo hi)]
              [left (val) (bst-between/c lo val)]
              [right (val) (bst-between/c val hi)])))

(define bst/c (bst-between/c -inf.0 +inf.0))
]

defines the @racket[bst/c] contract that checks the binary
search tree invariant. Removing the @racket[-opt/c] also
makes a binary search tree contract, but one that is
(approximately) 20 times slower.}

@section{@racketmodname[racket/contract/base]}

@defmodule[racket/contract/base]

The @racketmodname[racket/contract/base] module provides a subset
of the exports of @racketmodname[racket/contract] module. In
particular, it contains everything in the
@itemize[@item{@secref["data-structure-contracts"]}
         @item{@secref["function-contracts"]}
         @item{@secref["attaching-contracts-to-values"] and}
         @item{@secref["contract-utilities"] sections.}]

Unfortunately, using @racketmodname[racket/contract/base] does not
yield a significantly smaller memory footprint than
@racketmodname[racket/contract], but it can still be useful to
add contracts to libraries that @racketmodname[racket/contract]
uses to implement some of the more sophisticated
parts of the contract system.

  Constructs an old-style projection from a contract.

  The resulting function accepts the information that is in a @racket[blame]

@section{Random generation}

@defproc[(contract-random-generate [ctc contract?] [fuel int?] [fail (-> any/c) (Î» () (error ...))]) any/c]{
Attempts to randomly generate a value which will match the contract. The fuel
argument limits how hard the generator tries to generate a value matching the
contract and is a rough limit of the size of the resulting value.

The generator may fail to generate a contract, either because some contracts
do not have corresponding generators (for example, not all predicates have
generators) or because there is not enough fuel. In either case, the
thunk @racket[fail] is invoked.
