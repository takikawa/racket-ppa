@defclass[popup-menu% object% (menu-item-container<%>)]{

A @scheme[popup-menu%] object is created without a parent. Dynamically
 display a @scheme[popup-menu%] with @xmethod[window<%> popup-menu]
 or @xmethod[editor-admin% popup-menu].

A popup menu is @italic{not} a control. A @scheme[choice%] control,
however, displays a single value that the user selects from a popup
 menu. A @scheme[choice%] control's popup menu is built into the
 control, and it is not accessible to the programmer.


@defconstructor[([title (or/c label-string? false/c) #f]
                 [popdown-callback ((is-a?/c popup-menu%) (is-a?/c control-event%)
                                    . -> . any) 
                                   (lambda (p e) (void))]
                 [demand-callback ((is-a?/c popup-menu%) . -> . any) 
                                  (lambda (p) (void))]
                 [font (is-a?/c font%) normal-control-font])]{

If @scheme[title] is not @scheme[#f], it is used as a displayed title
 at the top of the popup menu.

If @scheme[title] contains @litchar{&}, it is handled specially, the
 same as for @scheme[menu%] titles. A popup menu mnemonic is not
 useful, but it is supported for consistency with other menu labels.

The @scheme[popdown-callback] procedure is invoked when a popup menu is
 dismissed. If the popup menu is dismissed without an item being
 selected, @scheme[popdown-callback] is given a @scheme[control-event%]
 object with the event type @indexed-scheme['menu-popdown-none]. If the
 popup menu is dismissed via an item selection, the item's callback is
 invoked first, and then @scheme[popdown-callback] is given a
 @scheme[control-event%] object with the event type
 @indexed-scheme['menu-popdown].

The @scheme[demand-callback] procedure is called by the default
@method[menu-item-container<%> on-demand] method with the object itself.

The @scheme[font] argument determines the font for the popup menu's
 items.
}


@defmethod[(get-font)
           (is-a?/c font%)]{

Returns the font used for the popup menu's items, which is optionally
 supplied when a popup menu is created.

}


@defmethod[(get-popup-target)
           (or/c (is-a?/c window<%>) (is-a?/c editor<%>) false/c)]{

Returns the context in which the popup menu is currently displayed, or
 @scheme[#f] if it is not popped up in any window.

The context is set before the @method[menu-item-container<%>
on-demand] method is called, and it is not removed until after the
popup-menu's callback is invoked. (Consequently, it is also set while
an item callback is invoked, if the user selected an item.)

}


@defmethod[(set-min-width [width (integer-in 0 10000)])
           void?]{

Sets the popup menu's minimum width in pixels.
