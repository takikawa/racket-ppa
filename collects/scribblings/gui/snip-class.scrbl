@defclass/title[snip% object% ()]{

A direct instance of @scheme[snip%] is uninteresting. Useful snips are
 defined by instantiating derived subclasses, but this class defines
 the basic functionality.

In deriving a new snip class, these methods must be overridden to
create a useful snip:

@itemize{

 @item{@method[snip% get-extent]} 

 @item{@method[snip% draw]} 

 @item{@method[snip% resize] if the snip can be resized by the user}

 @item{@method[snip% partial-offset] if the snip can contain more than
       one @techlink{item}}

 @item{@method[snip% split] if the snip can contain more than one @techlink{item}}

 @item{@method[snip% size-cache-invalid] if the snip caches the result to@method[snip% get-extent]} 

 @item{@method[snip% get-text] (not required)}

 @item{@method[snip% find-scroll-step], @method[snip%
       get-num-scroll-steps], and @method[snip%
       get-scroll-step-offset] if the snip can contain more than one
       scroll position}

 @item{@method[snip% set-unmodified] if the snip's internal state can
       be modified by the user, and call @method[snip-admin% modified]
       in the snip's administrator when the state changes the first
       time}

}

If a snip can contain more than one @techlink{item}, then the snip's @techlink{count}
 must be maintained as well.

To define a class of snips that can be saved or cut-and-pasted:

@itemize{

 @item{Create an instance of @scheme[snip-class%], implementing the
       @method[snip-class% read] method. Export the
       @scheme[snip-class%] instance as @scheme[snip-class] from a
       module, and use a classname of the form @scheme["(lib ...)"] as
       described in @|snipclassdiscuss|.}

 @item{For each instance of the snip class, set the snip's class object 
       with @method[snip% set-snipclass].}

 @item{Override the @method[snip% copy] method.}

 @item{Override the @method[snip% write] method.}

}

To define a class of snips that read specially with
@scheme[open-input-text-editor]:

@itemize{

 @item{Make your @scheme[snip%] class implement @scheme[readable-snip<%>].}

 @item{Implement the @method[readable-snip<%> read-special] method.}

}



@defconstructor/make[()]{

Creates a plain snip of length 1 with the @scheme["Basic"] style of
 @scheme[the-style-list].

@methspec{

Called (by an editor) to draw the snip into the given drawing context
 with the snip's top left corner at @techlink{location} (@scheme[x],
 @scheme[y]) in DC coordinates.

The arguments @scheme[left], @scheme[top], @scheme[right], and @scheme[bottom]
 define a clipping region (in DC coordinates) that the snip can use to
 optimize drawing, but it can also ignore these arguments.

The @scheme[dx] and @scheme[dy] argument provide numbers that can be
 subtracted from @scheme[x] and @scheme[y] to obtain the snip's @techlink{location} in
 editor coordinates (as opposed to DC coordinates, which are used for
 drawing).

See @|drawcaretdiscuss| for information about @scheme[draw-caret].

Before this method is called, the correct font, text color, and pen
 color for the snip's style will have been set in the drawing context
 already.  (This is @italic{not} true for @method[snip% get-extent] or
 @method[snip% partial-offset].)  The @method[snip% draw] method must
 not make any other assumptions about the state of the drawing
 context, except that the clipping region is already set to something
 appropriate. Before @method[snip% draw] returns, it must restore any
 drawing context settings that it changes.

See also @xmethod[editor<%> on-paint].

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for
 writing and reflowing when this method is called
 (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

}
@methimpl{

Draws nothing.

@defmethod[(find-scroll-step [y real?])

@methspec{

If a snip contains more than one vertical scroll step (see
 @method[snip% get-num-scroll-steps]) then this method is called to
 find a scroll step offset for a given y-offset into the snip.

}
@methimpl{

Returns @scheme[0].

}}


@defmethod[(get-admin)
           (or/c (is-a?/c snip-admin%) false/c)]{

Returns the administrator for this snip. (The administrator can be
 @scheme[#f] even if the snip is owned but not visible in the editor.)

}

@defmethod[(get-count)
           (integer-in 0 100000)]{

Returns the snip's @techlink{count} (i.e., number of @techlink{item}s
 within the snip).

}

@defmethod[(get-extent [dc (is-a?/c dc<%>)]
                       [x real?]

           void?]{
@methspec{

Calculates the snip's width, height, descent (amount of height which
 is drawn below the baseline), space (amount of height which is
 ``filler'' space at the top), and horizontal spaces (amount of width
 which is ``filler'' space at the left and right). Those values are
 returned by filling the @scheme[w], @scheme[h], @scheme[descent],
 @scheme[space], @scheme[lspace], and @scheme[rspace] boxes.

This method is called by the snip's administrator; it is not normally
 called directly by others. To get the extent of a snip, use
 @xmethod[editor<%> get-snip-location] .

A drawing context is provided for the purpose of finding font sizes,
 but no drawing should occur. The @method[snip% get-extent] and
 @method[snip% partial-offset] methods must not make any assumptions
 about the state of the drawing context, except that it is scaled
 properly. In particular, the font for the snip's style is not
 automatically set in the drawing context before the method is
 called. (Many snips cache their size information, so
 automatically setting the font would be wasteful.)  If @method[snip%
 get-extent] or @method[snip% partial-offset] changes the drawing
 context's setting, it must restore them before returning. However,
 the methods should not need to change the drawing context; only font
 settings can affect measurement results from a device context, and
 @xmethod[dc<%> get-text-extent] accepts a @scheme[font%] argument for
 sizing that overrides that device context's current font.

The snip's left and top @techlink{location}s are provided as @scheme[x]
 and @scheme[y] in editor coordinates, in case the snip's size depends
 on its location; the @scheme[x] and @scheme[y] arguments are usually
 ignored. In a text editor, the @scheme[y]-coordinate is the @italic{line's}
 top @techlink{location}; the snip's actual top @techlink{location} is
 potentially undetermined until its height is known.

If a snip caches the result size for future replies, it should
 invalidate its cached size when @method[snip% size-cache-invalid] is
 called (especially if the snip's size depends on any device context
 properties).

If a snip's size changes after receiving a call to
@method[snip% get-extent] and before receiving a call to
@method[snip% size-cache-invalid], then the snip must notify its administrator of the size change, so
 that the administrator can recompute its derived size information.
 Notify the administrator of a size change by call its
@method[snip-admin% resized] method.

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for writing and
 reflowing when this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

@methimpl{

Fills in all boxes with @scheme[0.0].

@defmethod[(get-flags)

Returns flags defining the behavior of the snip, a list of the
following symbols:

@itemize{

Sets the snip's @techlink{count} and notifies the snip's administrator
 that the snip's size has changed.

}}


@defmethod[(set-flags [flags (listof symbol?)])
           void?]{
@methspec{

Sets the snip's flags. See @method[snip% get-flags].

}
@methimpl{

Sets the snip flags and notifies the snip's editor that its flags have
changed. 

}}


@defmethod[(set-snipclass [class (is-a?/c snip-class%)])
           void?]{

Sets the snip's class, used for file saving and cut-and-paste.

This method stores the snip class internally; other editor objects may
 access the snip class directly, instead of through the @method[snip%
 get-snipclass] method.

}


@defmethod[(set-style [style (is-a?/c style<%>)])
           void?]{

Sets the snip's style if it is not owned by any editor.  See also
 @method[snip% get-style] and @method[snip% is-owned?].

The snip's style may be changed by the system without calling this method.

}


@defmethod[(set-unmodified)
           void?]{
@methspec{

Called by the snip's administrator to notify the snip that its changed
 have been saved. The next time snip's internal state is modified by
 the user, it should call @method[snip-admin% modified] to report the
 state change (but only on the first change after this method is
 called, or the first change after the snip acquires a new
 administrator).

}
@methimpl{

Does nothing.

}}


@defmethod[(size-cache-invalid)
           void?]{

@methspec{

Called to notify the snip that it may need to recalculate its display
 arguments (width, height, etc.) when it is next asked, because the
 style or @techlink{location} of the snip has changed.

The snip's (new) editor is usually internally locked for reflowing
 when this method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).

}

@methimpl{

Does nothing.

}}


@defmethod[(split [position exact-nonnegative-integer?]
                  [first (box/c (is-a?/c snip%))]
                  [second (box/c (is-a?/c snip%))])
           void?]{

@methspec{
Splits the snip into two snips. This is called when a snip has more
 than one @techlink{item} and something is inserted between two
 @techlink{item}s.

The arguments are a relative @techlink{position} integer and two
 boxes. The @techlink{position} integer specifies how many
 @techlink{item}s should be given to the new first snip; the rest go
 to the new second snip. The two boxes must be filled with two new
 snips. (The old snip is no longer used, so it can be recycled as a
 new snip.)

If the returned snips do not have the expected @techlink{count}s, their
 @techlink{count}s are forcibly modified. If either returned snip is already
 owned by another administrator, a surrogate snip is created.

The snip's editor is usually internally locked for reading when this
 method is called (see also @|lockdiscuss|).
}

@methimpl{

Creates a new @scheme[snip%] instance while @scheme[position]
elements, and modifies @this-obj[] to decrement its count by
@scheme[position]. The nest snip is installed into @scheme[first] and
@this-obj[] is installed into @scheme[second].

}}


@defmethod[(write [f (is-a?/c editor-stream-out%)])
           void?]{

Writes the snip to the given stream. (Snip reading is handled by the
 snip class.) Style information about the snip (i.e., the content of
 @method[snip% get-style]) will be saved and restored automatically.

}}
