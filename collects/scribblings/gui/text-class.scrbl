@defclass/title[text% object% (editor<%>)]{

A @scheme[text%] object is a standard text editor. A text editor is
 displayed on the screen through an @scheme[editor-canvas%] object or
 some other @techlink{display}.


@defconstructor[([line-spacing (and/c real? (not/c negative?)) 1.0]
                 [tab-stops (listof real?)]
                 [auto-wrap any/c #f])]{

The @scheme[line-spacing] argument sets the additional amount of space
 (in DC units) inserted between each line in the editor when the
 editor is displayed. This spacing is included in the reported height
 of each line.

See @method[text% set-tabs] for information about @scheme[tabstops].

If @scheme[auto-wrap] is true, then auto-wrapping is enabled via
 @method[editor<%> auto-wrap].

A new @scheme[keymap%] object is created for the new editor.  See also
 @method[editor<%> get-keymap] and @method[editor<%> set-keymap].

A new @scheme[style-list%] object is created for the new editor.  See
 also @method[editor<%> get-style-list] and @method[editor<%>
 set-style-list].

The contents of the @scheme[start] argument specifies an @techlink{position} to start
 searching backwards to the next word start; its will be filled with
 the starting @techlink{position} of the word that is found.  If @scheme[start] is
 @scheme[#f], no backward search is performed.

The contents of the @scheme[end] argument specifies an @techlink{position} to start
 searching forwards to the next word end; its will be filled with the
 ending @techlink{position} of the word that is found.  If @scheme[end] is
 @scheme[#f], no forward search is performed.

The @scheme[reason] argument specifies more information about what the
 wordbreak is used for. For example, the wordbreaks used to move the
 caret may be different from the wordbreaks used to break lines. The
 possible values of @scheme[reason] are:

@itemize{
@item{@scheme['caret] --- find a wordbreak suitable for moving the caret}
@item{@scheme['line] --- find a wordbreak suitable for breaking lines}
@item{@scheme['selection] --- find a wordbreak suitable for selecting the closest word}
@item{@scheme['user1] --- for other (not built-in) uses}
@item{@scheme['user2] --- for other (not built-in) uses}
}

The actual handling of @scheme[reason] is controlled by the current
 wordbreak procedure; see @method[text% set-wordbreak-func]for
 details. The default handler and default wordbreak map treats
 alphanumeric characters the same for @scheme['caret], @scheme['line],
 and @scheme['selection]. Non-alphanumeric, non-space, non-hyphen
 characters do not break lines, but do break caret and selection
 words.  For example a comma should not be counted as part of the
 preceding word for moving the caret past the word or double-clicking
 the word, but the comma should stay on the same line as the word (and
 thus counts in the same ``line word'').

In the normal mode for a text editor, style settings are sticky. With
 sticky styles, when a string or character is inserted into an editor,
 it gets the style of the snip preceding the insertion point (or the
 snip that includes the insertion point if text is inserted into an
 exiting string snip). Alternatively, if @method[text% change-style]
 is called to set the style at the caret @techlink{position} (when it
 is not a range), then the style is remembered; if the editor is not
 changed before text is inserted at the caret, then the text gets the

 style in the editor's style list named by @method[editor<%>

Editors collectively maintain a copy ring that holds up to 30 previous

 the copy ring, incrementing the ring pointer so that the next

It is a copy ``ring'' because the ring pointer wraps back to the most
 recent copied data after the oldest remembered data is pasted. Any
 cut, copy, or (regular) paste operation resets the copy ring pointer
 back to the beginning.
