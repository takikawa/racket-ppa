These are the files for the literate version of Chat Noir.  The files
not mentioned are actually in use for Chat Noir that you get via PLT
Games.

Problems:

 - Run in the module language doesn't seem to work anymore, in that
   definitions in the literate program don't show up in the REPL.

 - Need to make 'a-chunk' be a real macro, I expect. (used in
   scribble/private/lp.ss)

 - hyperlink bound top-level identifiers to their bindings?

 - do unbound chunk ids signal syntax errors? How about unused ones?

To document:

  @chunk
  scribble/lp (when it is added).
  scribble/lp-include
