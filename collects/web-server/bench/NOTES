	Removing all references to semaphores doesn't change much.

* data/1181787772.ss

	Removing the semaphores on connections---no longer needed---
	seems to improve the average case. 12ms were cut off. The
	memory usage seems strange.

* data/1181686382.ss

	The memory-usage data implies that there is a leak
	either in MzScheme, or in the server and the server-custodian
	is not being used correctly.
