This module is used internally to build and load servlets. It may be useful to those who are trying to extend the server.

         servlet?]{
 Creates a version 1 servlet that uses @scheme[directory] as its current directory, a timeout manager with a @scheme[timeout] timeout, and @scheme[start] as the request handler.
}

@defproc[(make-v2.servlet [directory path-string?]
                          [manager manager?]

         servlet?]{
 Creates a version 2 servlet that uses @scheme[directory] as its current directory, a @scheme[manager] as the continuation manager, and @scheme[start] as the request handler.
}

 Creates a stateless @schememodname[web-server] servlet that uses @scheme[directory] as its current directory, @scheme[stuffer] as its stuffer, and @scheme[manager] as the continuation manager, and @scheme[start] as the request handler.

@defthing[default-module-specs (listof module-path?)]{
 The modules that the Web Server needs to share with all servlets.
