@defmodule[web-server/configuration/namespace]{

This module provides a function to help create the
@scheme[make-servlet-namespace] procedure needed by the @scheme[make] function
of @schememodname[web-server/dispatchers/dispatch-servlets].

@defthing[make-servlet-namespace/c contract?]{
 Equivalent to 
 @schemeblock[
(->* ()
     (#:additional-specs (listof module-path?))
     namespace?)
]
}

@defproc[(make-make-servlet-namespace (#:to-be-copied-module-specs to-be-copied-module-specs (listof module-path?)))
         make-servlet-namespace/c]{
This function creates a function that when called will construct a new @scheme[namespace] that
has all the modules from @scheme[to-be-copied-module-specs] and @scheme[additional-specs], as well
as @scheme[mzscheme] and @scheme[mred], provided they are already attached
to the @scheme[(current-namespace)] of the call-site.

Example:
@schemeblock[
 (make-make-servlet-namespace
  #:to-be-copied-module-specs `((lib "database.ss" "my-module")))
 ]
}
                                  
}

@section{Why this is useful}

A different namespace is needed for each servlet, so that if servlet A and servlet B both use
a stateful module C, they will be isolated from one another. We see the @web-server as
an operating system for servlets, so we inherit the isolation requirement on operating systems.

However, there are some modules which must be shared. If they were not, then structures cannot
be passed from the @web-server to the servlets, because MzScheme's structures are generative.

Since, on occasion, a user will actually wanted servlets A and B to interact through module C.
A custom @scheme[make-servlet-namespace] can be created, through this procedure, that attaches
module C to all servlet namespaces. Through other means (see @secref["dispatchers"]) different sets
of servlets can share different sets of modules.
