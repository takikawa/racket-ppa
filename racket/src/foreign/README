========== libffi directory =============================================

Our copy of libffi for Racket has been changed in a few small
ways at git commit c3c40e0290377d7cf948b072eedd8317c4bf215e from

 http://github.com/atgreen/libffi

Local changes:

 * Test ftruncate() result in "closures.c" to avoid a compiler
   warning.

 * In "x86/darwin.S", added ".long 0" after ".LFE3:" to avoid
   linker problems compiling with gcc-4.0 on Mac OS X 10.7.

 * In "x86/ffi.c" for Win32, don't try to align stack for
   stdcall, fastcall, or thiscall.

 * In "x86/freebsd.S", align the stack pointer to 16 bytes.

========== libffi_msvc directory =====================================

This directory is synced from the CTypes repository

  http://svn.python.org/projects/ctypes/trunk/ctypes

revision 60274.
