#| resolver.rkt -- PLaneT client

1. Introduction

The PLaneT system is a method for automatically sharing code packages, both as
libraries and as full applications, that gives every user of a PLaneT client
the illusion of having a local copy of every code package on the server, but is
parsimonious in its transmission. It consists of a centralized server that
holds all packages and individual clients that hold some portion of the archive
locally. Maintenance of that archive should be transparent, and is the complete
responsibility of the PLaneT client.

2. Client behavior

The PLaneT client receives user requests (i.e., the "(require (planet ...))"
forms) and loads the appropriate modules in response. In the course of handling
these requests it may download new code packages from the PLaneT server.

2.1 User interface

The structure of user PLaneT invocations is listed below.

PLANET-REQUEST ::= (planet FILE-NAME PKG-SPEC [PATH ...]?)
FILE-NAME      ::= string
PKG-SPEC       ::= string | (FILE-PATH ... PKG-NAME)
                          | (FILE-PATH ... PKG-NAME VER-SPEC)
VER-SPEC       ::= Nat | (Nat MINOR)
MINOR          ::= Nat | (Nat Nat) | (= Nat) | (+ Nat) | (- Nat) 
FILE-PATH      ::= string
PKG-NAME       ::= string
OWNER-NAME     ::= string
PATH           ::= string

All strings must be legal filename strings.

When encountered, a planet-request is interpreted as requiring the given file
name from the given logical package, specified by the package spec and the
collection specification, if given. If no VER-SPEC is provided, the most recent
version is assumed. If no owner-name/path ... clause is provided, the default
package is assumed.

2. PLaneT protocol

PLaneT clients support two protocols for communicating with the PLaneT server:
the standard HTTP GET/response system (currently the default) and a specialized
TCP-based protocol that may become more important if PLaneT becomes smarter
about downloading packages behind the scenes.

In the following sections we describe the specialized protocol only.

2.1 Overview

1. PLaneT client establishes TCP connection to PLaneT server.
2. Client transmits a version specifier.
3. Server either refuses that version and closes connection or accepts.
4. Client transmits a sequence of requests terminated by a special
   end-of-request marker.  Simultaneously, server transmits responses to those
   requests.
5. Once the server has handled every request, it closes the connection.


I am concerned about the overhead of opening and closing TCP connections for a
large program with many requires, so I want to allow many requests and
responses over the same connection. Unfortunately there's a wrinkle: the
standard client, implemented the obvious way, would be unable to send more than
one request at a time because it gets invoked purely as a response to a require
form and must load an appropriate file before it returns. This means I can't
batch up multiple requires, at least not with an obvious implementation.

A possible solution would be to implement an install program that walks over
the syntax tree of a program and gathers all requires, then communicates with
the server and learns what additional packages would be necessary due to those
requires, and then downloads all of them at once. We would have to implement
both methods simultaneously, though, to allow for REPL-based PLaneT use and
dynamic-require (unless we want it to be a runtime exception to use PLaneT from
the REPL or via dynamic-require, something I'd rather not do), so I want a
protocol that will allow both forms of access easily. This protocol does that,
and doesn't require too much additional overhead in the case that the client
only takes one package at a time.

2.2 Communication Details

After a TCP connection is established, the client transmits a
VERSION-SPECIFIER:

VERSION-SPECIFIER ::= "PLaneT/1.0\n"

The server responds with a VERSION-RESPONSE:

VERSION-RESPONSE ::=
| 'ok "\n"
| ('invalid string) "\n"

where the string in the invalid case is descriptive text intended for display
to the user that may indicate some specific message about the nature of the
error.

If the server sends 'invalid, the server closes the connection. Otherwise, the
client may send any number of requests, followed by an end-of-request marker:

REQUESTS ::= { REQUEST "\n"}* 'end "\n"
REQUEST  ::= (SEQ-NO 'get PKG-LANG PKG-NAME (Nat | #f) (Nat | #f) (Nat | #f)
                     [OWNER-NAME PATH ...]?)
PKG-LANG ::= String
SEQ-NO   ::= Nat

The fields in a request are a uniquely identifying sequence number, the literal
symbol 'get, the name of the package to receive, the required major version and
the lowest and highest acceptable version (with #f meaning that there is no
constraint for that field, and a #f in major-version field implying that both
other fields must also be #f), and the package path.

As the client is transmitting a REQUESTS sequence, the server begins responding
to it with RESPONSE structures, each with a sequence number indicating to which
request it is responding (except in the case of input too garbled to extract a
sequence number):

RESPONSE ::=
| ('error 'malformed-input string) "\n"
| (SEQ-NO 'error 'malformed-request string) "\n"
| (SEQ-NO 'bad-language string) "\n"
| (SEQ-NO 'get 'ok Nat Nat Nat) "\n" BYTE-DATA
| (SEQ-NO 'get 'error ERROR-CODE string) "\n"

ERROR-CODE ::= 'not-found

If the server receives a malformed request, it may close connection after
sending a malformed-request response without processing any other
requests. Otherwise it must process all requests even in the event of an
error. On a successful get, the three numbers the server returns are the
matched package's major version, the matched package's minor version, and the
number of bytes in the package.

3 Client Download Policies

Racket invokes the PLaneT client once for each instance of a require-planet
form in a program being run (i.e., the transitive closure of the "requires"
relation starting from some specified root module; this closure is calculable
statically). At each of these invocations, the client examines its internal
cache to see if an appropriate module exists that matches the specification
given by the user (for details see the next section). If one does, the client
loads that module and returns. If none does, it initiates a transaction with
the server using the PLaneT protocol described in the previous subsection and
sends a single request consisting of the user's request.  It installs the
resulting .plt file and then loads the appropriate file.

The client keeps a cache of downloaded packages locally. It does so in the
$PLTCOLLECTS/planet/cache/ directory and subdirectories, in an intuitive
manner: each item in the package's path in the PLaneT require line correspond
to a subdirectory in the cache directory, starting with the owner name. (They
should be unpacked relative to some user-specific rather than
installation-specific place, possibly, but that's difficult to do so we won't
do it yet).

To check whether a package is installed when attempting to satisfy a
requirement, the client checks its cache to see if an appropriate entry exists
in its link-table for that require line.  If one exists, it uses the named
package directly. If none exists, it checks to see if there is an appropriate
subdirectory.

4. File Locking Behavior
