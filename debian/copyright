Everything in this package is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL) v2.1 or later, except for the the R5RS and SRFI docs, of which
the copyrights follow below. The text of the LGPL is not included in this file,
because there is a verbatim copy in /usr/share/common-licenses/LGPL on Debian
systems.

-------------------------------

readline collection notes:
GNU's readline library is covered by the GPL (found at
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL on Debian systems), and that applies to
code that links with it.  PLT Scheme is LGPL, so this code is not used by
default; you should explicitly enable it if you want to.  Also, be aware that
if you write code that uses this library, it will make your code link to the
readline library when invoked, with the usual GPL implications.

R5RS license:

    We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community,
    and so we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without
    fee.  In particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use
    this report as a starting point for manuals and other
    documentation, modifying it as necessary. 

Note from Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>: because the R5RS license wasn't clear
enough according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines, I asked the authors to
clarify what they meant. Here are their responses:
