readline collection notes:
GNU's readline library is covered by the GPL (found at
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL on Debian systems), and that applies to
code that links with it.  PLT Scheme is LGPL, so this code is not used by
default; you should explicitly enable it if you want to.  Also, be aware that
if you write code that uses this library, it will make your code link to the
readline library when invoked, with the usual GPL implications.

    *** The original version that this code was taken from was
    distributed with a GPL license, but later the code (later version of
    it) was also included in zlib, which is distributed with an
    LGPL-compatible license.  I (Eli Barzilay) have tried to contact the
    author, but no reply yet.

Note from Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>: because the R5RS license wasn't clear
enough according to the Debian Free Software Guidelines, I asked the authors to
clarify what they meant. Here are their responses:

(Comment from David Bremner <bremner@debian.org>, apparently Eli
Barzilay did the actual questioning and collecting of answers, with the
question provided by Ari).

    I got an answer back from the FSF "records" guy and he tells me that
    Will Fitzgerald elevated his reference implementation of SRFI 19 to
    the public domain. But this answer comes with a disclaimer:

     this is not a legal opinion, nor is this a binding pronouncment of
     the FSF

    so I don't know if we can rely on it.
