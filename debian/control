Description: PLT Scheme Programming Environment
 This is a Scheme Programming Environment, designed for use within
 an educational setting.  The faculty and staff at Rice University
 developed this package to be used in programming curricula, as a
 supplement to mathematics courses, or for general programming
 instruction in a liberal arts setting.
 .
 It includes its own IDE (which runs under X) and is similar in
 some respects to Emacs (most noticeably in its keybindings).
 .
 It has an integrated help system and can run one of four
 modes (beginning, intermediate, advanced, complete).  Each
 level exposes successively more features and options to the
 user.  The goal of this configuration is to protect novice users
 from the more arcane behavior of Scheme under certain cases.

Description: PLT Scheme Interpreter
 This scheme implementation forms the foundation for the DrScheme
 programming environment.  The faculty and staff at Rice University
 developed this package to be used as a stand-alone interpreter,
 for embedding in other applications, and for use with the
 DrScheme graphical environment.
