Description: extensible programming language in the Scheme family
 Racket (previously PLT Scheme) is a programming language suitable for
 scripting and application development, including GUIs and web
 services.
 .
 It supports the creation of new programming languages through a rich,
 expressive syntax system. Supplied languages include Typed Racket,
 ACL2, FrTime, and Lazy Racket, and R6RS Scheme.
 .
 Racket includes the DrRacket programming environment, a virtual
 machine with a just-in-time compiler, tools for creating stand-alone
 executables, the Racket web server, extensive libraries, and
 documentation for both beginners and experts.
