    - Remove debian/patches/sparc-compile-fix.patch, merged upstream.
    - Remove debian/patches/slatex-bug361027.patch, merged upstream.

    having optimizations enabled.  This also causes configure to be properly
    called with the --build option which allows hppa to be built with the
    foreign interface again.

  * Replace mzscheme & mred binaries with very small shell scripts to wrap
    around them and set the PLTCOLLECTS environment variable correctly,
    instead of adding the logic to the drscheme/web-server/etc. wrappers.
    This should fix user-specific collects directories not getting added when
    using drscheme.
  * Move /usr/local/lib/plt/collects creation/removal to postinst/postrm
    instead of including it and its parent directories in the package itself

  * Ugh. Fix a syntax problem in a Makefile-ism that wasn't
    passing the right thing to ./configure and was still causing FTBFS
    on m68k.
  * Restructure build so we don't need an enormous "clean" target in
    debian/rules, and the entire build system is much shorter now.
  * Make the split between drscheme/mzscheme closer to what upstream
    distributes in their plt-scheme/mzscheme binaries.
  * Try to generate compiled .zo files at build-time since it takes a long
    time and doesn't seem to work properly at install-time.

drscheme (205-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Just to be totally clear, drscheme and mzscheme both needed to be upgraded
    to fix the problem in 205-1.  So, declaring a versioned dependency.
  * Also, noticed that MrEd had the same libtool issue as MzScheme, so
    fixing that as well.

drscheme (205-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Correct documentation on setup-plt/debian-plt, since I had to swap the
    uses due to the many places the "real" setup-plt is needed by DrScheme
    and associated tools.  (Closes:#206503).
  * Modify installation scripts so that PLT environment variables are
    overridden with 'official' Debian paths to avoid building user
    PLTCOLLECT directories by accident.  (Closes:#204149).
  * Deactivate Xft support, since the xft2 libraries in Dylan are slightly
    incompatible.  Will rebuild with support once this is worked through.

drscheme (203-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using the PLT tarball has its disadvantages!  It turns out that most
    of the startup scripts were not autogenerated with the Debian paths,
    so they must be hand-edited.  Looks like I *may* have caught this
    before others...

  * Don't ship config.cache, config.log, or config.status.
  * Note:  Mark J Ray <markj@cloaked.freeserve.co.uk> has kindly agreed to
    help me out as a co-maintainer.  He should be extended all rights and
    priviledges due, etc. (Hopefully, he will take over the package full
    time, once he gets his Debian Developer's license.  He's much more
    suited for this, being involved in SRFI's and so forth.)

  * Don't bother building readline, as it is automatically built.  The
    automatically build binary has the wrong MD5 checksum, and creates
    the appearance of tomfoolery!  (Closes:Bug#163277)
  * Don't ship a copy of hdindex (it get's build automatically, which
