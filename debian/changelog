drscheme (1:352-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO!!!!!:
   - Do something about debian/patches/debian-collects.patch so that
     it actually does the right thing to add /usr/local/lib/plt/collects to
     (find-library-collection-paths)
   - Fix setup-plt so it will regenerate /usr/local/lib/plt/collects
     but not /usr/lib/plt/collects?

  [ Ari Pollak ]
  * New upstream release
    - Changes PLT documentation license to LGPL, and updates the license for
      R5RS and SRFIs (Closes: #356124, #356478)
  * Change build-depends on xlibs-data to xbitmaps
  * Fix small spelling mistake in package description (Closes: #363300)
  * Correct debconf web-server question to say http://localhost:8000
    instead of http://localhost
  * Remove old leftover drscheme debconf templates
  * Remove German debconf translation since it hasn't been
    updated in ages

  [ James Vega ]
  * New upstream release
    - Update debian/patches/debian-nonstandard-install.patch to apply against
      src/Makefile.in instead of install.
    - Remove debian/patches/debian-slib.patch, merged upstream.
    - Remove debian/patches/sparc-compile-fix.patch, merged upstream.
    - Remove debian/patches/slatex-bug361027.patch, merged upstream.
  * Rework packaging since upstream is using a saner build system now
    - Remove debian-plt and references to it.
    - Remove the mred and mzscheme wrapper scripts to override PLTCOLLECTS;
      instead, define our local collects path in collects/config/config.ss.
    - Move debian/{dr,mz}scheme.lintian-override to
      debian/overrides/{dr,mz}scheme and install using dh_install.
  * Override DEB_OPT_FLAGS instead of DEB_CONFIGURE_NORMAL_ARGS to avoid
    having optimizations enabled.  This also causes configure to be properly
    called with the --build option which allows hppa to be built with the
    foreign interface again.

drscheme (1:301-15) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Apr 2006 10:21:08 -0400

drscheme (1:301-14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switching to CDBS added -O2 to the compilation flags without
    me realizing, and mzscheme doesn't build properly on alpha & powerpc
    with that. So switch to never using -O2 in CFLAGS & CXXFLAGS.

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Apr 2006 23:05:56 -0400

drscheme (1:301-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move packaging to cdbs + simple-patchsys
  * Add James Vega to Uploaders list

    - Fix compile warning in src/mzscheme/src/list.c
  * debian/patches/slatex-bug361027.patch:
    - Added to support RequirePackage to start a LaTeX document
      when running slatex. Patch accepted upstream (Closes: #361027)

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2006 19:58:33 -0500

drscheme (1:301-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Somehow -10 lost a patch to src/mzscheme/src/Makefile.in that let this
    package actually compile on alpha. Add the patch back.

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2006 01:50:58 -0500

drscheme (1:301-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replace mzscheme & mred binaries with very small shell scripts to wrap
    around them and set the PLTCOLLECTS environment variable correctly,
    instead of adding the logic to the drscheme/web-server/etc. wrappers.
    This should fix user-specific collects directories not getting added when
    using drscheme.
  * Move /usr/local/lib/plt/collects creation/removal to postinst/postrm
    instead of including it and its parent directories in the package itself
  * Remove the dependency on libffi-dev and just stop building the foreign
    interface on hppa
  * Remove build-conflicts on libwxxt-dev, it doesn't exist anymore

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Feb 2006 22:53:43 -0500

drscheme (1:301-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Put /usr/lib/plt/include/ back in mzscheme instead of drscheme,
    and update mzscheme's Replaces field appropriately
    (Closes: #352130)

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Feb 2006 18:34:38 -0500

drscheme (1:301-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove libssl-dev from mzscheme dependencies; it's no longer needed
    since the openssl module is built during compile-time
  * Update slib conflicts on mzscheme to slib (<< 3a2-5) (Closes: #351655)
  * Add Conflicts: drscheme (<< 301-6) on drscheme package to try to
    fix problem where upgrading to mzscheme/drscheme 301-6 or higher from
    an earlier 301 revision would fail because of the old broken prerm scripts

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Feb 2006 13:52:26 -0500

drscheme (1:301-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * running setup-plt during the build process was causing the wrong
    paths to appear in cache.ss, so correct the paths manually in
    the resulting cache.ss file.

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Feb 2006 19:03:18 -0500

drscheme (1:301-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ugh. Fix a syntax problem in a Makefile-ism that wasn't
    passing the right thing to ./configure and was still causing FTBFS
    on m68k.
  * Restructure build so we don't need an enormous "clean" target in
    debian/rules, and the entire build system is much shorter now.
  * Make the split between drscheme/mzscheme closer to what upstream
    distributes in their plt-scheme/mzscheme binaries.
  * Try to generate compiled .zo files at build-time since it takes a long
    time and doesn't seem to work properly at install-time.
    - This fixes DrScheme slowness and the ProfJ errors (Closes: #351368)
    - This also fixes the slib catalog generation error (Closes: #347595)

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Feb 2006 14:09:56 -0500

drscheme (1:301-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Last try to fix m68k. Apparently FFI_CLOSURES is disabled on m68k,
    so the foreign interface won't build properly there. So just
    pass --disable-foreign to ./configure on m68k.
  * Add TODO.Debian to docs

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Feb 2006 12:01:37 -0500

drscheme (1:301-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a broken check for SunOS/Solaris that happened to cause
    a FTBFS on SPARC.

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Feb 2006 23:29:32 -0500

drscheme (1:301-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Trying again to fix the ffi (foreign) interface on hppa and m68k.
    mzscheme includes its own copy of libffi, so let's try
    building against the system-wide libffi library instead.
  * Remove mzscheme's dependency on libreadline5-dev

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Feb 2006 01:27:54 +0000

drscheme (1:301-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix drscheme & mzscheme prerm to properly remove stuff that gets
    created at install-setup-time.
  * Add libffi4-dev to build-depends to hopefully fix a FTBFS on m68k & hppa

 -- Ari Pollak <ari@debian.org>  Thu,  2 Feb 2006 21:07:44 -0500

drscheme (1:301-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add stuff from notes/ in /usr/share/doc/mzscheme
  * src/mred/wxs/Makefile.in, ssrc/wxxt/src/Makefile.in:
    - Explicitly add -I/usr/include/freetype2 to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
      so that Xft support will compile, since upstream
      doesn't use pkg-config.

drscheme (1:209-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * -fPIC was sort of defined in CFLAGS already, but it wasn't being included

     (Closes: #328368)
  * Remove --enable-noopt from configure invocation unless DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS ==
    noopt. I'm not sure why it was there in the first place.
  * Update X build-depends so we don't pull in all of xlibs-dev unnecessarily.

       - Don't explicitly depend on libfreetype6, it's detected automatically

      (version-specific), as well as updated copyright info.
  * debian/control: s/libreadline4-dev/libreadline5-dev/ (Closes: #287976)
      Also removed some references to Rice University and replaced them with

drscheme (1:206p1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    build properly during install.  (Closes:#220785)
  * Correct web server startup script.  (Closes:#219709)
  * Added dependency on libfreetype6.  I hope this will help with bug #219795.

drscheme (205-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Just to be totally clear, drscheme and mzscheme both needed to be upgraded

  * Also, noticed that MrEd had the same libtool issue as MzScheme, so
    fixing that as well.

  * Correct documentation on setup-plt/debian-plt, since I had to swap the
    uses due to the many places the "real" setup-plt is needed by DrScheme
    and associated tools.  (Closes:#206503).
  * Modify installation scripts so that PLT environment variables are
    overridden with 'official' Debian paths to avoid building user
    PLTCOLLECT directories by accident.  (Closes:#204149).
  * Deactivate Xft support, since the xft2 libraries in Dylan are slightly
    incompatible.  Will rebuild with support once this is worked through.

drscheme (203-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Using the PLT tarball has its disadvantages!  It turns out that most
    of the startup scripts were not autogenerated with the Debian paths,
    so they must be hand-edited.  Looks like I *may* have caught this
    before others...

drscheme (202.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporate a few patches to allow a build under HPPA.
    (Closes:Bug#104880).  Add hppa to the architectures list.
  * Can't recreate fvwm2 behavior.  Probably fixed when DrScheme was
    rewritten for the 200-series.  (Closes:Bug#126161)
  * Don't ship config.cache, config.log, or config.status.
  * Note:  Mark J Ray <markj@cloaked.freeserve.co.uk> has kindly agreed to
    help me out as a co-maintainer.  He should be extended all rights and
    priviledges due, etc. (Hopefully, he will take over the package full
    time, once he gets his Debian Developer's license.  He's much more
    suited for this, being involved in SRFI's and so forth.)

    (Closes:Bug#163285)(Closes:Bug#163285)
  * Don't bother building readline, as it is automatically built.  The
    automatically build binary has the wrong MD5 checksum, and creates
    the appearance of tomfoolery!  (Closes:Bug#163277)
  * Don't ship a copy of hdindex (it get's build automatically, which
    causes MD5 checksum errors.)(Closes:Bug#161731)
