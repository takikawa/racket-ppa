drscheme (1:352-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release drops out-of-the-box support for installing system-wide
    collects into /usr/local/lib/plt/collects. Hopefully upstream will provide
    an easier way to allow us to set this in the future; in the meantime,
    I just wanted to get this release out as soon as possible.
    You can still manually add the old directory to the search path
    by setting PLTCOLLECTS="/usr/local/lib/plt/collects:" before 
    running mzscheme/mred/drscheme.
